/**
 * Modular route registration
 *
 * This file provides the infrastructure for splitting routes into logical modules.
 * Routes can be gradually migrated from the monolithic routes.ts file.
 *
 * Suggested structure:
 * - routes/torah.ts - Torah content endpoints (/api/torah/*)
 * - routes/tefilla.ts - Prayer endpoints (/api/mincha/*, /api/maariv/*, etc.)
 * - routes/tzedaka.ts - Donation and campaign endpoints
 * - routes/tehillim.ts - Tehillim-specific endpoints
 * - routes/admin.ts - Admin-only endpoints
 * - routes/analytics.ts - Analytics and stats endpoints
 * - routes/media.ts - Media proxy and upload endpoints
 * - routes/calendar.ts - Calendar and time-related endpoints
 * - routes/public.ts - Public content (shop, sponsors, etc.)
