# Deployment Configuration Fixed

## Issue Resolved
The deployment failure was caused by security flags detecting 'dev' commands in the configuration. The system correctly identified that development settings should not be used in production.

## Solution Applied
✅ **Production Configuration Active**: The `replit.deployment.toml` file contains proper production settings that override development configurations during deployment:

- **Build Command**: `vite build && node build.mjs`
- **Run Command**: `node production.js` 
- **Environment**: `NODE_ENV=production`
- **Port**: `5000`

✅ **Production Entry Point**: `production.js` file exists and properly configured
✅ **Build Script**: `build.mjs` handles TypeScript compilation with path resolution
✅ **Static Assets**: Frontend built to `dist/public` directory
✅ **Server Bundle**: Backend compiled to `dist/index.js`

## Deployment Status
**Ready for Production Deployment**

The deployment system will automatically use the production configuration from `replit.deployment.toml`, ignoring the development settings in `.replit`. All required files are present and the build process works correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Click the Deploy button in Replit
2. The system will automatically run the production build sequence
3. The application will start using `node production.js` in production mode

The deployment configuration is now secure and production-ready.
