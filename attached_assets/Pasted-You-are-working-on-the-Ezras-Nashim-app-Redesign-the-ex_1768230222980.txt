You are working on the Ezras Nashim app. Redesign the existing Analytics screen to match the provided mockup (warm feminine pastel, clean + modern). Keep all existing data + logic; change UI only.

GOALS
- Use the app’s existing color palette (pink / lavender / cream). Reuse existing theme tokens if they exist. Do not introduce a new palette file unless none exists.
- Make the page feel “premium iOS”: minimal shadows, soft rounded cards, lots of whitespace, clear typography hierarchy.
- Preserve current functionality: Today/Week/Month/All Time switching, totals, feature usage list.

LAYOUT (match mockup)
1) Header
- Title: “Analytics” centered in the top app bar.
- Keep back button on left and refresh icon on right if they exist.

2) Segmented control (Today / Week / Month / All Time)
- iOS-style segmented control:
  - Outer pill container (light pastel background).
  - Selected tab: slightly darker pastel fill + bold text.
  - Unselected tabs: transparent background.
  - Height ~44, rounded corners ~22, subtle border or none.
- The selected tab changes the data range (existing logic).

3) “Today” KPI Section (top summary)
- Centered:
  - Small label: “Today”
  - Large number: total mitzvos/actions (e.g., 309)
- Under the number, a small pill “Most used: <feature name>” (computed from the feature usage list for that range).
  - If you already have “most used” logic, reuse it; otherwise compute by max usage count.

4) Category breakdown row (3 cards)
- One row of 3 equal cards: Torah / Tefilla / Tzedaka
- Each card:
  - Left: small icon + label
  - Center/bottom: big number
  - Background: white/cream, very subtle shadow OR a faint border (prefer border).
  - Rounded corners ~18–20
  - Spacing between cards consistent

5) Feature Usage section
- Section title: “Feature Usage”
- A large rounded container card holding the list
- Each row:
  - Left icon + feature name
  - Right aligned count
  - For all rows EXCEPT the top one (highest count), show a subtle horizontal progress bar (pastel fill on a pale track) proportional to top count.
  - Add thin dividers between rows (very light).
- Keep it scrollable if needed.

STYLING RULES
- Reduce heavy shadows/glows from the current design.
- Use consistent spacing:
  - Page padding: 16–20
  - Section spacing: 20–24
  - Card padding: 14–16
- Typography:
  - Numbers: semibold, large (KPI biggest)
  - Labels: medium weight, smaller
  - Avoid mixing too many font styles; use the app’s default font system.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
- Find the current Analytics screen component (likely something like Analytics.tsx / analytics_screen.dart / AnalyticsScreen).
- Do not change API calls, data models, or analytics calculations other than adding “Most used” + progress bar percentages.
- Build a reusable component:
  - <SegmentedControl />
  - <StatCard />
  - <FeatureUsageRow />
- Ensure dark mode doesn’t break (if app supports it): use theme tokens and adjust borders/backgrounds accordingly.

DELIVERABLE
- Update the Analytics screen UI to match the mockup.
- Make sure it compiles and looks correct on iPhone sizes.
- Provide the code changes (files modified) and a short summary of what you changed.
