🔍 Replit Full App Audit Prompt

Role & Mindset
You are a principal software architect + senior product engineer performing a full professional audit of an existing production app.
Act like this app is preparing for real users, scale, and monetization.
Be direct, critical, and practical. Do not be polite. Do not hand-wave.

📂 Scope

Audit the entire codebase and system, including but not limited to:

Frontend

Backend / APIs

Database schema & queries

Auth & permissions

State management

Background jobs / schedulers

Integrations (payments, messaging, storage, etc.)

Deployment & environment setup

Performance & scalability

Security & privacy

UX & product flow

Error handling & logging

🧠 What I Want From You

Produce a structured audit report with the following sections in this exact order:

1️⃣ Executive Summary (Non-Technical)

One-paragraph summary of the overall health of the app

Biggest strengths

Biggest risks

Is this app safe to scale? (Yes / No + why)

2️⃣ Architecture Review

Current architecture diagram (describe in text)

What is well designed

What is fragile or wrong

What will break first at scale

Suggested architecture improvements (practical, not theoretical)

3️⃣ Code Quality & Maintainability

Folder structure & separation of concerns

Reusability

Naming conventions

Dead code / duplication

Tech debt score (1–10)

Refactoring priorities (ranked)

4️⃣ Performance & Scalability

Obvious performance bottlenecks

Inefficient queries or loops

Client vs server load issues

How this behaves at:

100 users

10,000 users

100,000 users

Concrete optimization steps

5️⃣ Security & Privacy Audit (CRITICAL)

Authentication weaknesses

Authorization flaws

Data exposure risks

Injection / XSS / CSRF risks

Secrets handling

File upload risks

Rate limiting / abuse prevention

Compliance risks (PII, minors, payments, etc.)

🚨 Call out any critical vulnerability clearly.

6️⃣ Database & Data Integrity

Schema quality

Indexing issues

Over/under-normalization

Risk of data corruption

Backup & recovery readiness

Migration readiness

7️⃣ Error Handling & Observability

Where errors are swallowed

Missing try/catch

Logging gaps

Monitoring recommendations

What will be impossible to debug later

8️⃣ Product & UX Review

User journey walkthrough

Friction points

Confusing flows

Missing empty states

Edge cases that will confuse users

Monetization or conversion blockers (if applicable)

9️⃣ Replit-Specific Improvements

How to better leverage Replit features

Dev environment issues

Secrets & environment handling

Preview / deployment setup

Suggested Replit workflow improvements

🔟 Action Plan

Create a prioritized TODO list with:

🔥 Critical (must fix immediately)

⚠️ Important (before launch / scale)

🧹 Cleanup (tech debt)

🚀 Nice-to-have improvements

Each item should include:

What to fix

Why it matters

Rough effort (S / M / L)

📌 Rules

Be specific: reference actual files, functions, and patterns

No generic advice

No “it depends”

If something is missing, say so explicitly

If something is good, explain why
