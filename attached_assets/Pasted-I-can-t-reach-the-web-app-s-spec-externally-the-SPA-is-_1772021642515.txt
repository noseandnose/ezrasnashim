I can't reach the web app's spec externally — the SPA is catching all routes including /api/spec.json. You'll need to get the spec from the web project directly.

In the meantime, here's the full list of our 48 mobile API routes organized by category. You can paste this into the web app project to compare:

Here's the full mobile app API inventory to compare against the web app. Ask it which of these it's missing:

Paste that into your web app project and ask it to compare against its own routes. It'll tell you what it has and what it's missing. Also, the web app's /api/spec.json endpoint isn't reachable externally right now — the SPA frontend is catching that URL and returning HTML. You may want to tell the web project to fix that routing so the spec is publicly accessible.
