3,27/07/2025,ONEG V’KAVOD SHABBOS  (ENJOYING AND HONORING  SHABBOS),"The Torah says, “On the seventh day, it will be a day of rest, a holy day.” 1 The Medrash teaches that this means that one must honor Shabbos. In addition, the Prophet says, “And you shall make it a joyous day.” 2 Our Sages explain that this means one must enjoy Shabbos, 3 by wearing clean clothes and preparing special food. This mitzvah is not to be taken lightly. Our Sages tell us that anyone who makes Shabbos special “inherits a great portion, is saved from the rule of the foreign world, and merits wealth.” 4 Three Levels of Honoring Shabbos_ • Those who can, should buy special foods like fish, meat, and wine (or whatever other food would be fitting) in honor of Shabbos. Our Sages teach, “One’s livelihood is set during the days between Rosh HaShanah and Yom Kippur, except for [the monies] spent on Shabbos, where the more one spends, the more Hashem adds to his livelihood, and the less one spends, Hashem decreases from it.” 6 • One who is very limited in funds should at least try to buy something small that is special for Shabbos. He should even take a small loan in order to do so, if he has a way to pay it back. Hashem promises, “If one takes a loan in order to honor Shabbos, I (Hashem) will pay [it] back.” • However, one who is extremely poor should not depend on others to do this mitzvah , and he certainly should not take out a loan. He should, however, attempt to minimize his weekday expenditures in order to do something small for the sake of Shabbos. NOTE: Spending for Shabbos is a great mitzvah. However, it should be done with- in reason. Furthermore, it should be done in order to honor Shabbos, not just for one’s own enjoyment. When one buys special things for Shabbos, it is good to say, “ Lichvod Shabbos Kodesh — [I am buying it] for the honor of the holy Shabbos.” 7",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1.

The more one honors Shabbos — whether by buying food or drinks, or by wearing special clothes — the more praiseworthy. 9",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"8. Mishnah Berurah  242:2.

5,29/07/2025,HONORING AND PREPARING  FOR SHABBOS - BREAD,"Bread One should eat special Shabbos bread, commonly known as challah, and in some places, kitke , at the Shabbos meals. In general, Ashkenazim are permitted to eat bread baked by a non-Jewish bakery, provided that the ingredients and vessels used are kosher, and it is baked only in a proper bakery (and not at home). This is why some Jewish courts of law will investigate and issue a ruling that government bread is kosher. This is known as pas palter (bread of a non-Jewish baker). Nevertheless, it is a good stringency to only eat bread baked by a Jew, known as pas Yisrael (bread of a Jew). However, it is fitting to bake one’s own bread in honor of Shabbos. There is also the added mitzvah of separating challah from the dough. If one does not bake challah, he should certainly try to buy bread that was baked by a Jew ( pas Yisrael ). (Of course, if one is unable to do either of these, he may still use pas palter for his Shabbos meals.) 10",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,10. Ibid. 242:6.
6,30/07/2025,"HONORING AND PREPARING FOR  SHABBOS, CONTINUED - SHABBOS CLOTHING","Shabbos Clothing One should wear special clothes in honor of Shabbos. This is seen from the verse that says, “ v’chibadeto (and you shall honor it).” 11 One way to honor Shabbos is by changing from weekday clothes into special Shabbos clothing. One should not merely wear Shabbos clothes in shul. Rather, he should try to keep them on throughout Shabbos__ (unless one is sleeping, etc.). The Vilna Gaon would even change his belt, and the Chazon Ish would change his yarmulke in honor of Shabbos. One is not required to change his undergarments, provided that they are clean. 13 One also need not change his shoes if they are presentable. However, doing so is praiseworthy ( middas chassidus ). It is praiseworthy to have a special tallis for Shabbos, if it is within one’s means. 14",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"11. Yeshayahu  58:13.

This is hinted to in the Shemoneh Esrei of Mussaf of Shabbos, where we say, “ To’amehah chaim zachu — Those who taste it merit life.” It also reminds us that the joy of Shabbos is merely a taste of the joy of the World to Come. If one plans to actually swallow what he is tasting, he must make a brachah . Interestingly, one who is accustomed to do so during the year is permitted to taste the food even on the erev Shabbos that falls out within the first nine days of Av, when we are usually not permitted to eat meat. 20 (Some say that one is only permitted to taste, and not to swallow. 21 )",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"19.

Mishnah Berurah  250:3.
11,04/08/2025,"HONORING AND PREPARING FOR  SHABBOS, CONTINUED","On Friday morning, one should get up early enough (and earlier than nor- mal, if necessary) to have enough time to prepare for Shabbos. 23 Shabbos preparations include buying and preparing the necessary food and getting the house in order, among other things. This obligation is seen directly from the Torah: “They collected the mann each morning . . . On the sixth day, they prepared what they had brought.” 24 The obligation is on the person who is responsible for the Shabbos prepa- rations. 25 Nevertheless, even if all the Shabbos preparations have been made, one should always do something to personally prepare for Shabbos. A mitzvah done by oneself is greater than if it is done by someone else on his behalf. 26 Therefore, the more one personally prepares for Shabbos, the more praisewor- thy he is. Furthermore, it should not be below one’s dignity to do so. We find that the Amora’im__ (the Sages from the time of the Talmud) took time off to cut vegetables, chop wood, light the fire, and clean the house. Giving honor to Shabbos is an honor for oneself. A person should not postpone the Torah learning that he is accustomed, to after Shacharis in order to prepare for Shabbos. 28 However, if those preparations cannot be done after his learning, he must prepare for Shabbos first and learn Torah afterwards. Furthermore, although it is generally forbidden to work before one has davened Shacharis , one may prepare for Shabbos before davening. However, he should be careful to daven and say Shema within the right time. During the winter, when the days are short, it is recommended to start some of the preparations before Friday. 29",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"23. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  250:1.

Either way, one should not simply discard nails. Ideally, one should burn them, though it is also permitted to bury them. Flushing them down the toilet is widely considered to be like burying them. 36 In places that women do not frequent, such as a beis medrash , one is per- mitted to discard nails. Nails only pose a danger in the place where they have fallen. Once they have been moved, they no longer pose a danger. Therefore, if one mistakenly dropped a nail, he should sweep that area, and need not worry thereafter. 37 A pregnant woman should avoid a beauty salon (where manicures and ped- icures are done) because of the high likelihood of stepping on nails. 38",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"35.

But the period before then — that is, from the time that the sun begins to set — is the subject of Halachic uncertain- ty. We rule strictly and consider this time night, and therefore, Shabbos. 92 (On Saturday at sunset, we also rule strictly, and still consider it Shabbos day until we are certain that nightfall has begun.) Tzeis hakochavim (stars are out): The Halachic uncertainty ends when there are three stars out. 93 From this point on, it is nightfall, and therefore, on Friday, it is certainly Shabbos, and on Saturday, it is certainly no longer Shabbos. It is worth emphasizing that one should consult the luach , which gives the accurate times for both shkiyah and tzeis hakochavim . If one does not have a luach and is thus uncertain whether it is shkiyah , he must consider it to be Shabbos and not do any melachah . 94",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"92.

Example: New York in midwinter: Plag haminchah is_:41 p.m. This is the earliest time that one can light can- dles. It is one and a quarter Halachic hours before sunset. Shkiyah is_:39 p.m. From this point, it is considered Shabbos. Tzeis hakochavim is at_:24 p.m. At this point, it is night without question. • According to the Mishnah Berurah , one should allow for twenty minutes of tosefes Shabbos , and thus light by_:19 p.m. • The custom in New York is to allow for eighteen minutes of tosefes Shabbos , which is why the calendar says that one must light before_:21 p.m. • The absolute latest time, in a case of great necessity, and definitely not on a regular basis at all, is to light five minutes before shkiyah , by_:34 p.m.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"95.

However, since her lighting ushers in Shabbos, she must make the brachah after she lights. She should not benefit from the candles before she has made the brachah . This is why she covers her eyes after lighting. 108 One should not extinguish the match after lighting the candles, because extinguishing is a forbidden melachah . Therefore, one should drop the match onto a nonflammable surface. If that is not possible, she should have in mind to bring in Shabbos only after making the brachah , and in this case, she can put out the match. Men do not usually usher in Shabbos by candle-lighting. Therefore, when men are doing the lighting, they can make the brachah beforehand. 109 Although it is permitted to light one Shabbos candle using another Shab- bos candle, the custom is to use a separate candle to light them. 110 (This is also true regarding Chanukah candles — it is better to use a separate candle to light them all.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"108.

This is true until eighteen minutes before shkiyah . 113 In cases of extreme need, this may be done until five minutes before shkiyah . It is customary to daven by the Shabbos candles. In particular, one should daven for righteous children. 114 Indeed, the Gemara says, “One who is surround- ed by Shabbos or Chanukah candles will merit children who are talmidei cha- chamim (Torah scholars).” This is why there is a tefillah printed in the siddur after the blessing on candle-lighting. It is meritorious to give tzedakah before lighting Shabbos candles. A husband who sees that his wife will not light on time should himself light immediately to prevent desecration of Shabbos. Furthermore, a husband is also held accountable for the sins of his house, so it is his responsibility to ensure that there is no chillul Shabbos . 115",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"111.

48,10/09/2025,BOUND BY ONE’S SHUL,"We have discussed the latest time to light candles. However, there is another consideration to be aware of. At the point that Mizmor Shir L’Yom HaShabbos (after Lecha Dodi ) is said in shul, Shabbos is in. 116 This applies equally to men and women. If Mizmor Shir has been said in one’s shul, then he is automatically bound to it, and Shabbos is in — even if it is still quite early. If there is only one shul in the city, then everyone in the city is bound by that one shul. 117 This is particularly relevant in big shuls that have a set time throughout the year for Kabbalas Shabbos . In the summer, even though actual sunset is later, since Mizmor Shir is said earlier in the shul, one who regularly davens in that shul is bound by that time. Although one must stop doing melachah eighteen minutes before shkiyah , or if necessary, no more than five minutes before shkiyah , (or not after Mizmor Shir L’Yom HaShabbos is said in shul, whichever is earliest), some Poskim rule that there is an additional requirement of actually expressing the acceptance of Shabbos verbally. That is, one must say, “I hereby accept upon myself the Shab- bos.” Again, this is an additional action even though the prohibition of doing melachah is in place anyway. 118",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"116.

49,11/09/2025,ARRIVING IN SHUL  AFTER KABBALAS SHABBOS,"If one arrives late to shul on Friday night, and the congregation has already started saying Mizmor Shir L’Yom HaShabbos , he may not daven Minchah among them. Rather, he must go outside to daven Minchah . This is because the shul has announced the arrival of Shabbos, and he is davening a tefillah that is contrary to that announcement. 119 One who has not davened Minchah can only answer the Barchu that starts off Maariv if he has in mind not to accept Shabbos yet. Without having in mind not to accept Shabbos, his answering Barchu is an automatic acceptance of Shab- bos, and he can no longer daven the Minchah that he is still obligated in. 120 If one did join in with Barchu without having in mind not to accept Shabbos with it, or if the time for Minchah has already passed (usually thirteen minutes after shkiyah ), he must daven two Shemoneh Esreis during Maariv . The first is said together with the congregation, as usual, fulfilling his Shabbos Maariv obligation. Afterwards, he says the exact same Shemoneh Esrei (of Shabbos Maariv ) to make up for missing Minchah . 121 (It is worth mentioning that one may not plan to daven twice to make up a missing tefillah . It is only permitted to make up a tefillah when one missed it by mistake or against his will.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"119. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  263:15.

50,12/09/2025,EATING THREE MEALS  ON SHABBOS,"There is a Rabbinic obligation to eat three bread meals on Shabbos___ — one in the evening and two during the day. Years ago, people were accustomed to eat two meals a day during the week, and the Sages added an extra meal to honor Shabbos. The three meals are also hinted to in the passuk “And Moshe said, eat today , for it is Shabbos today ; today you will not find mann in the field.” Like all the mitzvos of Shabbos, this obligation applies to both men and women (see Day__), since both benefitted from the mann . 123 Our Sages tell us, “One who eats the three Shabbos meals will be saved from the pangs of Moshi- ach, the war of Gog and Magog, and the judgment of Gehinnom.” 124 One must eat at least one beitzah (egg’s worth) of bread at each meal. How- ever, since the obligation for three meals is d’Rabbanan (Rabbinical), one can measure it based on the size of the eggs that we have today, and not the size of the eggs of earlier generations, which was much larger. 125 The volume of a beitzah is_ ounces, or__.6 grams (cubed). 126 Although all of the meals should be fitting for the honor of Shabbos by consisting of delicacies___ such as meat, fish, or wine, one should reserve the very best food for the Shabbos day meal (lunch). 128",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"122.

Especially during the winter, one should have the foresight not to overeat during the morning meal, so that he will be able to eat his third meal later on. If one has inadvertently overeaten and finds it difficult to eat another meal, he is not required to do so if it will cause him discomfort. 131 Our custom is to eat seudah shelishis after Minchah . 132 Still, if one has eaten it before Minchah , he need not eat it again, so long as his meal was completed a Halachic half hour past midday. 133 One must try to start seudah shelishis before shkiyah (sunset). If he did not, the latest time that he can still wash depends on the place he is in. In Eretz Yisrael, it is thirteen minutes after shkiyah , but other places may have a longer period of sunset, and the time within which to start the seudah will be later. 134 If one has a limited amount of food, seudah shelishis takes precedence over melaveh malkah (see Day__, where the halachos of melaveh malkah are discussed in depth). 135",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"129.

52,14/09/2025,KIDDUSH ON FRIDAY NIGHT,"The Torah says, “Remember the Shabbos to make it holy.” 136 Our Sages obligated us to carry out this mitzvah over a cup of wine. 137 Men and Women Hashem miraculously commanded us about two aspects of Shabbos in the same instant. Zachor (remember) is the requirement to recall the Shabbos day, and shamor (guard) is the requirement to abstain from melachah . Since women are bound by the mitzvos of shamor (the prohibitions), they are automatically included in the mitzvos of zachor . Thus, women are obligated to hear or recite Kiddush, even though it is a time-bound positive mitzvah . 138 Nevertheless, although they have the same level of obligation, our Sages teach that it is fitting that the man of the house make Kiddush for the women. 139 Children A child below the age of bar or bas mitzvah who can understand the con- cept of Shabbos (this is usually at the age of six or seven, and depends on the child’s abilities) is Rabbinically obligated in the mitzvah. 140 However, since his level of obligation is lower than that of men or women whose obligation is on a Torah level, he may not recite Kiddush on their behalf. 141 He may say Kiddush on behalf of another child. (Regarding Yom Tov, there is a debate regarding the obligation of Kiddush for women, because zachor was only said regarding Shabbos. The Ashkenazi custom is that they have taken on the practice of doing the mitzvah (with the brachos ). However, since their level of obligation is weaker, they may not recite Kiddush for men (which is not ideal in any case), who have a Torah obligation, nor for children, who have a definite Rabbinic obligation. 142 )",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"136.

53,15/09/2025,EATING BEFORE KIDDUSH,"When one arrives home, he should make Kiddush promptly. 143 It is forbidden to eat or drink once Shabbos arrives (either through lighting Shabbos candles or because Mizmor Shir has been recited in shul) until Kiddush is recited. 144 This applies to men and women, but not to children. Some Poskim allow a woman who has lit candles and is thirsty, to drink as long as it is not yet shkiyah . 145 One is not permitted to take tasty medicine until after Kiddush, as it is considered food (obviously, if one is in a life-threatening situation, everything must be done to save his life). 146 Even a pregnant woman (who often has leniencies) must recite Kiddush before eating or drinking unless she feels undue weakness. This is often applicable when women wait at home until their husbands return from shul, such as on Simchas Torah. If they need to eat or drink, they should make Kiddush themselves and eat bread or cake to fulfill their obligation, which will be discussed in Day__. If one ate or drank before Kiddush, he must still make Kiddush before con- tinuing. 147 If one forgot to make Kiddush and realized after saying HaMotzi (before eating), he should say the second brachah of Kiddush ( Asher Kideshanu ) on the challah, and then eat it. 148 He need not make any brachah on wine, because the brachah of Kiddush may be recited over bread on Friday night, if necessary. If one remembered only after eating the bread, he must immediately recite Kid- dush on a cup of wine as usual, with both brachos , and then he may continue eating. 149",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"143.

54,16/09/2025,KOS SHEL BRACHAH  (THE CUP OF WINE  USED FOR A MITZVAH),"Several rules apply to the cup of wine that is used on mitzvos, known as the kos shel brachah . These mitzvos include Kiddush, bentshing , and Havdalah, as well as many other occasions. Although one should try to fulfill these rules, 150 if any are not possible, one may still make the brachah . 151 Mallei (Full) The Kiddush cup must be mallei (full). 152 Therefore, instead of using a large cup that will only be filled two-thirds or three-quarters of the way, one should use a smaller cup that is full. The minimum amount of wine required in the cup for Kiddush is a revi’is. The exact measurement of this is discussed in Day__. One may not use two small cups that would form a revi’is if combined. The cup must be able to hold a revi’is by itself. One must drink at least a cheekful from the cup. However, one should pref- erably drink most of the revi’is . 153 One must drink it within the usual time that it would take to drink that amount. If it takes any longer, it is considered a hefsek (a Halachic separation), and invalidates the Kiddush. 154 One is permitted to share the minimum amount that must be drunk with other people. If one’s wife is a niddah , he may not pass the kos shel brachah to her. Instead, she can come and get it. Alternatively, he can set it on the table, and someone else at the table can pass it to her. Pagum (Blemished) Once a cup has been sipped from, it is considered pagum (blemished). Ide- ally, the wine in that cup should not be used for a mitzvah. 155 The following are the ways to fix this, in order of preference: 156 • One should pour some wine from the wine bottle into the cup, thereby purifying it. Then, he should pour the wine in the cup back into the bottle. One can then use the wine in the bottle for a mitzvah. • One should pour some wine from the bottle into the cup. • If there is a revi’is left in the cup, one should pour it into a smaller cup where it will fill the cup to the top. 157 As we said earlier, if there is no other option, one can still make the bra- chah on it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"150.

Shalem (Complete) The cup used may not be broken or cracked, even at the stem. 158 Preferably, one should not use a polystyrene or disposable cup. But if these are the only options, it is permitted. 159 Shetifah V’Hadachah (Washing and Rinsing) One should rinse the cup before using it. However, if it is obviously clean, or one wipes the cup, he need not rinse it. 160 Mizug (Diluting) If the wine is very strong, one must put a drop of water into it to make it fit to drink. There are mystical reasons for this as well. However, the Mishnah Berurah says that our wines are so light already that they do not need to be diluted. 161 L’Sheim and Samuch (for the Purpose of the Brachah, and Close to It) One should pour the wine only when he is about to start Kiddush. When he pours it, he should do so for the purpose of the brachah . 162 One should not fill the cup and leave it, causing a significant delay before the brachah . Atarah (Crowning) Our Sages say that we should ”crown” the cup. 163 It is not clear what this means. Some say to leave a little space below the rim, so that the gap at the top is a “crown.” Others say that one should fill it over the brim, so that the top forms a “crown” over the bottom. The Vilna Gaon said that it means putting little cups around the big cup to “crown” it. Whatever the case, we are not clear on this, and therefore, one need not be concerned about it. We have explained previously that one may still make the brachah even if he is unable to do any of these things.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"158. Mishnah Berurah  183:11.

56,18/09/2025,"KOS SHEL BRACHAH, CONTINUED","We have been discussing the rules that apply to a kos shel brachah (the cup of wine used for a mitzvah). Atifah (Wrapping) Our Sages say that one should wrap himself during the brachah . The Mishnah Berurah explains that one who fears Heaven should wear a hat, and if possible, a jacket, when making the brachah . 164 Shtei Yadayim, Yemin (Two Hands, the Right Hand) One should pick up the cup with both hands___ to demonstrate his love for the mitzvah . He should then place it in his right hand for the recital of the brachah . One should not wear gloves when reciting the brachah on the cup. 166 Some say that for Kabbalistic reasons, one should hold the cup in his palm, and stretch out his fingers to touch the cup. When making Kiddush, a left-handed person should hold the cup in his left hand, unless it will be too shaky or insecure. 167 Tefach (Raising the Cup a Handbreadth) One must raise the cup from its base by at least a tefach (a handbreadth), which is_.54 inches/9 centimeters above the surface. 168 This is relevant for one who sits while making Kiddush, or one who is bent- shing over a cup of wine. If one is standing, he should try to ensure that the cup is visible to everyone, if possible. Hesech HaDaas (Gazing at the Cup) One should look at the cup while reciting the brachah of HaGafen , to prevent distraction. This also signifies that Hashem watches over us, in the same way that we are watching the mitzvah that Hashem has commanded us. However, if one needs to look in a siddur, he certainly should do so. 169 Meshager L’Ishto (Sending to His Wife) When one makes a brachah on a kos shel brachah , he should always give the cup to his wife to drink, as it brings blessings upon her. 170 However, if one is a visitor, he should not give it to his wife, nor to the wife of the host. Instead, he should give it the host, to bring blessings upon him, and the blessings will automatically transfer onto his wife, the hostess, too. 171 Niddah As mentioned previously, one may not pass the cup directly to his wife when she is a niddah . 172 Rather, he can put his cup down, and others can pass it, or she can come and get it herself. Some Poskim rule that if he pours many cups for the many people present, she can take one, as it was not designated for her. The above requirements are the best way to do the mitzvah of kos shel bra- chah . However, if one is unable to accomplish any of the above items, he may still make the brachah on the cup. Below, we will discuss crucial criteria, without which one may not make the brachah on the cup.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"164. Mishnah Berurah  183:11.

57,19/09/2025,CRUCIAL CRITERIA FOR KIDDUSH,"The conditions that were listed until this point were the mitzvah min hamu- vchar (the best way to accomplish the mitzvah). If one is unable to fulfill them, he may still recite Kiddush. However, the following two factors are crucial, and if they are absent, it may mean that one has not fulfilled the mitzvah , and needs to do it again. Shome’a K’Oneh — Reciting on Behalf of Others and the Proper Way to Listen When saying the brachah on behalf of others, the speaker must have in mind to include the listeners in the mitzvah . The listener must also have in mind to fulfill his mitzvah through the one reciting the brachah . 173 It is recommended to remind everyone present of these requirements before one recites Kiddush. 174 There is a debate regarding the need to repeat the brachah if the speaker or the listener did not have the proper intentions in mind. However, the fact that they are all at a table during such a ceremony means they probably recognize the existence of Shabbos and the desire to hear Kiddush. Thus, b’dieved ( post facto ), this fact may be enough to warrant not repeating the brachah . 175 Note that one’s intention during the brachah is more important than an- swering Amen. This is because everyone agrees that failing to answer Amen does not affect the brachah .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"173. Rama ,  Orach Chaim  167:2.

58,20/09/2025,THE CUP OF WINE: FULFILLING THE MITZVAH OF KIDDUSH,"HOW TO FULLFILL TORAH OBLIGATION Kiddush is a Torah obligation . One is able to fulfill it merely by davening Maariv and saying the blessing of Mekadesh HaShabbos . Some even say that saying “Good Shabbos” or saying Mizmor Shir L’Yom HaShabbos is enough to fulfill the mitzvah to proclaim Shabbos. 176 Measurements Chazal said that Kiddush should be said on a cup that holds a revi’is of wine. There is an uncertainty as to the minimum measurement of a revi’is. 177 Thus, because Kiddush on Friday night is a Torah mitzvah, the Mishnah Berurah rules that one should use the higher measurement, which is_.4 ounces/130 millili- ters. 178 Some even use_.3 ounces/149.3 milliliters, based on the ruling of the Chazon Ish. 179 For a Rabbinic mitzvah, one may use the minimum measurement of_.3 ounc- es/97.5 milliliters. 180 See footnote for other opinions of the minimum measure- ment. This applies to Kiddush on Shabbos day, as it is only a Rabbinic obligation. How Much to Drink One is required to drink melo lugmav (one’s cheekful) from the cup used for Kiddush (or any mitzvah). 181 As mentioned earlier, if one wishes, the cheekful can be distributed among the people who are fulfilling their Kiddush obligation through that cup. The cheekful is measured based on the person drinking, and is not an ob- jective amount. Anyone who is fulfilling the requirement to drink the cheekful must drink from the cup that contains the revi’is . 182",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"176.

59,21/09/2025,KIDDUSH IN SHUL  ON FRIDAY NIGHT,"Then and Now In historical times, visitors to a town would eat at the shul. For this reason, the chazzan made Kiddush for them at the end of davening. They would start their seudah (meal) soon afterwards. (We will learn that one can only make Kiddush in a place where he will have a seudah .) Today, however, people do not eat in shul, and so, the Kiddush would actu- ally be invalid since it is not recited where the meal is eaten. Interestingly, the custom of making Kiddush in shul still remains in some places. It is only a ceremony, and not a real Kiddush, because there is no seudah accompanying it. 183 Nevertheless, one must stand for the Kiddush. 184 Who Should Drink the Wine As we learned earlier, one is not permitted to drink before reciting or hear- ing a valid Kiddush. Since the shul Kiddush is not a valid Kiddush, the chazzan should preferably not drink the wine. Rather, he should give it to a child who has reached the age of chinuch (generally six or seven years old) and is old enough to understand the concept of Shabbos. 185 Children are permitted to eat or drink before Kiddush. Yet, the child is old enough to be Rabbinically obligated in Kiddush. This is why it is not a problem for him to drink the wine. If there are no children available, the chazzan should drink an entire revi’is , as the cup by itself can be considered a seudah for him, and the Kiddush will therefore be valid for him. See Day__ for the measurement required. The chazzan can still recite Kiddush for his family. This is because when it comes to brachos on mitzvos, one may say the brachos on behalf of others even if he has already fulfilled his own mitzvah . 186",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"183.

60,22/09/2025,VAYECHULU:  STANDING OR SITTING? - VAYECHULU,"VaYechulu is a powerful paragraph in the Torah. The Medrash says that we should say it three times over Shabbos: during Maariv , after Maariv , and be- fore Kiddush. 187 Our Sages teach us that anyone who says VaYechulu becomes a partner with Hashem in Creation! This is because it testifies to the fact that He is the Creator of the world, which He completed on Friday evening. If one forgot to say  VaYechulu becomes a partner with Hashem in Creation! This is because it testifies to the fact that He is the Creator of the world, which He completed on Friday evening. If one forgot to say VaYechulu during Kiddush, he should still say it during the meal, preferably over a cup of wine. 188 Standing or Sitting during Kiddush: Three Opinions The Shulchan Aruch rules that one should stand during VaYechulu , as it serves as testimony that Hashem is the Creator, and testimony must be given standing. This is the custom for Sefaradim. 189 The Rama requires the entire Kiddush to be recited in a fixed state ( kvius ), not as a random event. Therefore, he rules that it is better to sit throughout Kid- dush, including during VaYechulu . So far as the Shulchan Aruch ’s claim regarding testimony, he writes that VaYechulu was already said (while standing) in shul, and the requirement for testimony has already been fulfilled. However, one should still stand at the start of Kiddush for the words “ Yom hashishi vayechulu hashamay- im ,” as the first letters of these words make up Hashem’s Name, and we should show Him honor by standing. This would be the custom for Ashkenazim. 190 However, Rav Moshe Feinstein (among others) made an interesting com- promise of both opinions. He says that one should stand for the whole of VaYechulu (thereby fulfilling the requirement to stand during testimony), and then sit for the brachos . 191 This is also the advisable practice for someone who does not have a custom regarding standing and sitting for Kiddush. Those that have a family custom should follow it. 192 Looking at the Candles Before Kiddush One should gaze at the candles before Kiddush commences. 193 (Our Sages tell us that one should not walk with large paces, as it leads to a loss of_/500th of one’s vision. If one did so, our Sages taught us that the way to fix it is to look at the candles before Kiddush on Friday night.) 194 Note that, as we have said, one should look at the cup while reciting the brachah , or read from the siddur, if necessary.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"187.

61,23/09/2025,WASHING BEFORE OR AFTER KIDDUSH,"The Shulchan Aruch rules that one should make Kiddush before washing for bread, in order to prevent the Kiddush from being a hefsek (interruption) between washing and the brachah of HaMotzi . It follows that the rest of the people present, who will not actually say Kiddush, can wash first if they want to. 195 However, the Rama rules that one should wash before making Kiddush. This is because he holds that there is no Halachic hefsek (interruption) between washing and HaMotzi , as Kiddush is a prerequisite to eating bread (as it is for- bidden to eat bread until Kiddush has been recited). 196 The Mishnah Berurah concludes that it is best to make Kiddush before wash- ing, like the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch . However, both customs have strong reasons behind them, and are mandated by these great Poskim . Therefore, one should not change his family custom. Similarly, if one is a guest whose host has a different custom from his own, he should do as the host does. Furthermore, in a case of difficulty, such as if one is running a camp or Shabbaton where it is difficult to get people in and out, he certainly can rely on the Rama, and wash before reciting Kiddush.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"195.

62,24/09/2025,THE REQUIREMENT  OF EATING AFTER KIDDUSH,"A person does not fulfill the mitzvah of Kiddush (both on Friday night and Shabbos day) unless he eats a “meal” soon afterwards. 197 How Much and What to Eat The minimum requirement for a “meal” is a k’zayis of bread or mezonos (anything made principally from the five grains: wheat, barley, spelt, rye, or oats). A k’zayis is_.96 ounces/28.8 grams (cubed). 198 One who does not eat a k’zayis (about the size of a matchbox) of bread or mezonos after hearing or saying Kiddush has not fulfilled his obligation. Even if one ate fruit, vegetables, rice, or sweets, he has not fulfilled his obligation. 199 Even if the one who recited Kiddush ate, this does not help anyone else to fulfill their obligation. 200 In the case of a need (such as if there is no cake left and one is weak, or if someone is unable to eat the five grains), one can rely on drinking a revi’is of the Kiddush wine, but this is only an option on Shabbos morning. On Friday night, a revi’is of wine is not considered enough of a meal (except by the custom of making Kiddush in shul). 201 See Day__ for the exact measurements of a revi’is . The “meal” should ideally be eaten immediately after Kiddush. 202 Howev- er, if one is forced to wait a few minutes before eating, he has still fulfilled his obligation. 203",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"197.

63,25/09/2025,KIDDUSH B’MAKOM SEUDAH  (EATING A MEAL IN THE  SAME LOCATION AS KIDDUSH),"The Meal Must Be a Kvius We have stated that a person has not fulfilled his Kiddush obligation unless he eats a “meal” after hearing or saying Kiddush. The meal must be a kvius (es- tablished, set). Ideally, one should sit when eating the meal that follows Kiddush, so that it takes on the form of a real meal. Even if one does not sit, he certainly should not walk around at the time Kiddush is being made. 204 The Meal and the Kiddush Must Be in the Same Place Furthermore, the “meal” must be in the place where one made or heard Kiddush. 205 If one made Kiddush in one place and plans to eat in a completely different place, his Kiddush is not valid. 206 However, in certain cases, the Kiddush is still valid: • If the place where Kiddush was made and its accompanying meal are under the same roof • If the place where Kiddush was made and its accompanying meal are in sight of each other To illustrate, Kiddush will be valid even though the meal is not in the exact same place in the following situations (in order of preference): • Kiddush is on one side of the room, and the meal is on the other side of that same room. • Kiddush is in one room of the house, and the meal is in another room of that same house. • The meal is in a completely different house from the one where Kid- dush was made, but one can see the place where Kiddush was made from the place where the meal takes place. This should only be relied upon if there is no other option. 207 (Note that if one physically would not be able to get there or one is not allowed to be there, such as if the gate between them is locked or the passage between the two areas is prohibited, seeing will not cause the Kiddush to be valid. 208 ) Awning If one has an awning that stretches from his house or roof, the space un- derneath it is considered part of the house, as long as there is no gap of_,44 inches/24 centimeters between the awning and the roof. 209 Porch According to some Poskim , a porch or veranda is considered part of the house. 210 Leaving the Place Where Kiddush Was Made If a person leaves the place where Kiddush was made, after having drunk the wine: • If he had in mind to eat there, and something suddenly caused him to leave, he is permitted to eat when he returns shortly thereafter, and he does not need to make Kiddush again. 211 • If he did not have in mind to eat right there, and he leaves (regardless of the reason), he has to make Kiddush again when he returns. 212 • If he left the place for the purpose of the meal itself, such as going out- side in order to wash his hands for HaMotzi that will be eaten on his return or even to go to the restroom, he must not make Kiddush again. 213",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"204.

Then he should cover them again, until he finishes the brachah of Mekadesh HaShabbos . On Shabbos Day: He makes Kiddush on chamar medinah (any respectable social drink for which one would invite a friend over). This depends on what is normal in each specific place. Examples of chamar medinah may include freshly squeezed orange juice, 219 and according to some, Coke, beer, 220 whiskey, or even coffee, depending on what is a respectable drink in that place. Water or milk definitely may not be used. 221 One should say the normal Kiddush of Shabbos day, and replace the brachah of HaGafen with SheHakol . If one does not have chamar medinah , or holds like the Chazon Ish that there is no such thing in our time, he is also permitted to make Kiddush over the challah. 222",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"214.

65,27/09/2025,COVERING THE CHALLAH,"One should cover the challah during Kiddush with a mat or cloth above and below it. 223 There are two reasons for this: 224 • Generally, one is required to start off a meal with bread, followed by everything else that is secondary to it. However, on Shabbos we start off the meal with the wine of Kiddush. Therefore, to avoid “embarrassing” the challah, we cover it. (This reason only necessitates a cover above the bread.) • It is a reminder of the miraculous mann of the desert, which was sealed with dew above and below it. (This reason necessitates a cover below and above the bread.) The custom is to rely on the challah board or even the tablecloth as the bottom “mat.” One must definitely keep the cover on until the end of Kiddush (based on the first reason), although some say that one should keep it covered until after HaMotzi (to extend the reminder of the mann ). To avoid the problem of embarrassing the challos, the Vilna Gaon would only place them on the table after Kiddush, and he covered them during Ha- Motzi based on the second reason. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv recommended this practice. This halachah applies to Kiddush, but not to seudah shelishis . 225 At a Large Seudah At a large seudah , when there are many challos on the the tables, the only challos that need to be covered are the ones in front of the person making Kid- dush. 226 This is because the rest of the bread will not suffer embarrassment, as no wine is being drunk at that place. Similarly, when making Kiddush and having mezonos as one’s mandatory “meal,” the only mezonos that must be covered is what is in front of whoever drinks from the wine.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"223.

66,28/09/2025,DRINKING WINE OR OTHER  BEVERAGES AFTER KIDDUSH,"Other Wine Brought in During the Meal___ Once a person has drunk a cheekful of wine, the HaGafen made can cover all other wine drunk during the meal. However, if he had no intention to drink any other wine, and that other wine was not in front of him during Kiddush, he must make a new HaGafen if he wishes to drink it. (In some circumstances, he may need to make the brachah of HaTov V’HaMeitiv , but that is beyond the scope of this book.) Other Beverages After Wine___ Wine is known as the “head of all drinks.” Its brachah has the power to cover the brachah of all other beverages that follow it. Thus, if one said or heard Kiddush and drank a cheekful of wine, he would not say a SheHakol on any beverage that he drinks afterwards, as long as he had intent to drink it or it was in front of him at the time. Note, however, that this is only if he himself drank a cheekful of wine from the Kiddush. If he merely heard Kiddush from someone else and ate mezonos without drinking a cheekful (that is, only the one who made Kiddush drank), he has to make a SheHakol on food or drink that requires it. Brachah Acharonah The after- brachah made on wine is Al HaGefen , whereas the after- brachah on any other beverage is Borei Nefashos . One only makes any after- brachah on a beverage when he has drunk a revi’is . Again, wine will eliminate the need for an after- brachah on any other beverage. If one has drunk a revi’is of wine, even if he also had a revi’is of some other drink, he makes only an Al HaGefen , and that covers the other beverages. For the measurement of a revi’is , see Day__.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,
67,29/09/2025,LECHEM MISHNEH - LECHEM MISHNEH,"Lechem Mishneh When saying HaMotzi at any meal on Shabbos, one must be holding two whole loaves or rolls. This mitzvah is known as lechem mishneh (double bread). It commemorates the great miracle of the two portions of mann collected by the Jewish nation on erev Shabbos while they sojourned in the desert. 229 The challos should ideally be full, without significant cuts, scrapes, or burns. 230 According to some Poskim , even if one will not eat bread after Kiddush, but rather mezonos , he should hold two full pastries or baked foods together to fulfill the obligation of lechem mishneh . 231 Women are also obligated in Lechem Mishneh . 232 Making a Cut in the Challah Before HaMotzi Some people have the custom to make a slight cut in the challah they plan to eat before making the brachah , to enable them to start cutting immediately after the brachah . This does not render the challah incomplete as it does not cut deeply into the challah. 233 Leniencies If necessary, one is permitted to use a frozen challah as part of lechem mishneh . 234 If one does not have two whole loaves or rolls, he should still say HaMotzi holding one whole loaf and one slice. If he has no whole loaves then he should use two pieces or slices of bread. 235 Intention As with all other mitzvosthat are fulfilled through another person, the leader should have in mind to carry out the mitzvahof lechem mishneh for all of the other participants, and they should have in mind to fulfill the mitzvah through him. 236 No Lechem Mishneh (B’Dieved) The rules stated above are the correct way to do the mitzvah . However, one who does not have two whole rolls can and must still eat a k’zayis of any bread or cake to fulfill the mitzvah of Kiddush, and a beitzah ’s worth (an egg’s size) of bread in order to fulfill the mitzvah of having three seudos on Shabbos. 237",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"227.

68,30/09/2025,"LECHEM MISHNEH, CONTINUED","We have said that when one makes HaMotzi , he must hold both loaves or rolls. On Friday night Based on Kabbalah, the challah that will be eaten must be at the bottom, and the other one at the top. 238 However, this presents a problem of ein maavirin al hamitzvos (we do not pass up on the earliest opportunity to perform a mitzvah), and so, passing over the top (closer) challah, in favor of the bottom one, is an issue. There are three ways to avoid this: 239 • One can ensure that the edge of the bottom challah sticks out closer to himself than the top one. In this way, the bottom challah is actually the earlier opportunity. • As one completes the brachah , he can roll the challos over, so that the bottom becomes the top. • One can cut and eat from both challos. (This was the practice of the Vilna Gaon.) 240 On Shabbos morning The challah that one plans to eat should be on top. Asking Permission It is proper to say “Birshus Rabbosai — With the permission of [those pres- ent].” If one is receiving challah from the leader, he should not start eating until the leader has started. However, if one has his own lechem mishneh and is merely relying on the leader’s HaMotzi , he can begin eating as soon as the brachah is complete. 241",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"238.

(“ Baruch Attah Hashem lamdeini chukecha ” is a verse in Tehillim , and is not considered the start of the next brachah .) Then he should say Retzei , and continue with U’vnei . . . • If he remembered after completing the brachah of Bonei [B’Rachamav] Yerushalayim , but before starting the words HaKel Avinu Malkeinu , he does not say Retzei. Instead, there is a special brachah insert that was composed for Shabbos, which is found in some siddurim and bentshers .

72,04/10/2025,ONE HUNDRED BRACHOS DAILY,"A man must try to say one hundred brachos every day. This was established by Dovid HaMelech (King David) in response to an epidemic in which one hundred people were dying every day. 248 The count of one hundred brachos begins and ends at nightfall. Weekday On a regular day, it is not too difficult to complete one hundred brachos : • HaMapil (before going to sleep) — 1 • Asher Yatzar (after using the bathroom) — 1 • Al Netilas Yadayim (after washing in the morning) — 1 • Birchos HaTorah ( brachos made daily before learning Torah) — 3 • The Morning Brachos — 16 • The brachah on the tallis — 1 • Brachos on tefillin — 2 • Baruch SheAmar — 1 • Yishtabach — 1 • Birchos Krias Shema (The brachos that are said before and after the morning Shema) — 3 • Birchos Krias Shema (The brachos that are said before and after the eve- ning Shema) — 4 in Eretz Yisrael, 5 outside of Eretz Yisrael • Shemoneh Esrei ( Shacharis , Minchah , and Maariv — 19 each) — 57 • Al Netilas Yadayim , HaMotzi , and Birchas HaMazon (before and after eating bread) — 4 The count so far is__, and does not include other foods and other oppor- tunities for Asher Yatzar . Shabbos and Yom Tov On Shabbos and Yom Tov, when the Shemoneh Esrei is significantly shorter (only seven brachos each), one needs to try to find ways to make up thirty-six brachos that are missing. Here are some ways in which one can come to reciting more brachos , thus completing the one hundred brachos : • Kiddush (evening and morning) — 3. • Eating more delicacies and snacks, such as cookies, fruit, nuts, vegeta- bles, and candy. • Smelling sweet spices, fragrant branches, or herbs. (Four brachos exist for pleasant smells — see Day__.) • Listening carefully to the brachos said by each person that is called to the Torah. On Shabbos, there are__ in the morning and_ in the afternoon. On Yom Tov, there are__. 249 • Listening to the brachos of the haftarah carefully — 4. • If necessary, using the brachos of the Chazzan’s Repetition by Shacharis , Mussaf , and Minchah . 250 • If necessary, using the brachos hinted at in Ein K’Elokeinu . 251 NOTE: It is important not to say brachos just to reach the one hundred target if there is no Halachic basis for the brachah . 252 Although the scope of this book does not extend to brachos , it is worth mentioning the general principle that if one is unsure if a brachah is needed, he should not say it. Women Most Poskim rule that women are not obligated in saying one hundred brachos . 253",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"248. Mishnah Berurah  46:14.

73,05/10/2025,KIDDUSH BY DAY - EATING BEFORE KIDDUSH,"Eating Before Kiddush One of the halachos that is slightly different from those of the nighttime Kiddush is the prohibition regarding eating before making Kiddush. 255 We have said that on Friday night, Shabbos begins for women with can- dle-lighting, or a maximum of five minutes before shkiyah or when Mizmor Shir is recited in shul — and one is forbidden to eat or drink (even water) before hearing Kiddush. However, on Shabbos morning, there is another factor. There is a general rule that one may not eat before he has davened Shacharis . Since Kiddush needs to be accompanied by a “meal,” it follows that effectively, one may not eat until after having davened Shacharis . 256 However, one is permitted to eat or drink before Shacharis on Shabbos what- ever he is normally permitted to eat or drink during the week before he begins to daven. Examples of this include water or even coffee if it will help him daven. 257 Still, once one has davened Shacharis , he is forbidden to eat or drink anything before making Kiddush. Women Before explaining the rule for women, one needs to know the obligation of tefillah for women. There are two opinions: 1. According to the Mishnah Berurah , the halachah is that women have an obligation to daven the Amidah twice a day ( Shacharis and Min- chah ). 258_. There is another opinion that rules that women need just say a “re- quest” (for example, “Please, Hashem, help me today” or “Help my husband learn Torah”), and that fulfills their obligation of tefillah . This opinion is not the halachah. Regarding Kiddush, since it is difficult for women to wait until they have davened a whole Amidah to eat or drink, they can rely on the second opinion and say a small request (or the Torah and Morning Blessings), and that will qualify as a tefillah . However, once they have said this “ tefillah ,” they are automatically obligated to make Kiddush, and they may not eat until they have done so. (They should also remember to daven the Amidah later.) 259 Sick People People who feel extremely unwell may eat and drink before tefillah . However, this means that they are obligated in Kiddush as soon as they wake up. Thus, they also may not drink water or coffee until they have fulfilled this obligation (unless they need to do so for medical reasons). 260 NOTE:As previously mentioned, children are permitted to eat and drink before Kiddush. 261",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"254.

74,06/10/2025,LEARNING TORAH ON SHABBOS,"The Medrash states that the Torah asked Hashem, “When Klal Yisrael will conquer Eretz Yisrael and they will have to tend to their fields and vineyards, what will happen to me? Will I be neglected?” Hashem replied, “Your partner is Shabbos, for on that day, all will be free to delve into you!” 262 Indeed, the Gemara says, “Shabbos and Yom Tov were given [to us] for the purpose of learning Torah, as only then are people free to learn.” 263 The Gemara says that one of the causes of lost wealth is that people eat and plan meals during the time designated for learning on Shabbos. 264 The Halachah The Shulchan Aruch rules that it is forbidden to plan an extra meal after the Shabbos-morning meal, because that time is designated for Torah learning. 265 It is true that eating on Shabbos is a fulfillment of the mitzvah of oneg Shabbos (enjoying Shabbos), but one may not cause bittul Torah (neglect of Torah learn- ing) because of it. However, it is permitted to spontaneously eat an extra meal that was not planned. 266 Similarly, one should not extend the Shabbos seudah longer than necessary, because of bittul Torah . 267 What to Learn Any Torah learning is always good. Still, the Mishnah Berurah states that one should attempt to learn (or hear a shiur in) some practical hilchos Shabbos , as well as Agadeta (stories) that will motivate a person to grow in yiras Shamayim (fear of Heaven). 268 The Shelah HaKadosh writes that one should try to discover a chiddush (an idea that one did not know until that point) on Shabbos. This is because when the second neshamah that a person is gifted with for Shabbos leaves and ascends to heaven, Hashem asks of it, “What new insight did you come back with?” Sleeping on Shabbos The Rama teaches that one who usually takes a nap in the afternoon should do so on Shabbos in order to fulfill the mitzvah of oneg Shabbos . However, the nap should not extend too long, as it will waste precious time for Torah learning. 269 (One may not say that he is resting in order to have strength for the coming week, as it appears as if he is preparing for after Shabbos on Shabbos. 270 ) Torah scholars, who learn the entire week, are encouraged to eat and rest a bit more than those who do not learn all week, and for whom Shabbos is a vital opportunity to learn Torah. 271",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"262.

75,07/10/2025,MAARIV AND HAVDALAH WHEN  SHABBOS ENDS - TOSEFES SHABBOS,"Tosefes Shabbos as Shabbos Departs Just as there is a mitzvah to add on to Shabbos as it arrives (i.e., the eigh- teen minutes before sunset), so too there is a mitzvah to add on to Shabbos as it departs. In this case, even a minute is sufficient, although the more one adds, the greater the mitzvah . 273 Today, we have calendars that calculate the time of tzeis hakochavim (includ- ing a minute or two for tosefes Shabbos ), and one can and should rely on them even on a cloudy day. Maariv on Motzaei Shabbos The custom is to lengthen the pronunciation of the words V’Hu rachum and Barchu at the start of Maariv . There are three reasons given for this: • To add on to Shabbos, as discussed above. 274 • To delay the return of the wicked back to Gehinnom. (The wicked are granted a reprieve from Gehinnom during Shabbos, and they are returned to it after U’Va L’Tzion .) 275 • It is a segulah (omen) for success. 276 Not Eating Before Havdalah Just as it is forbidden to eat or drink before one has made Kiddush, so too is it forbidden to do so before making Havdalah.

76,08/10/2025,MAARIV ON MOTZAEI SHABBOS:  ATTAH CHONANTANU,"Ideally, one must first daven Maariv and say Attah Chonantanu , and only afterwards make Havdalah. However, if one waited until tzeis hakochavim for some reason, and made Ha- vdalah before davening Maariv , he still says Attah Chonantanu during Maariv . 277 Attah Chonantanu is said during the first of the “request” brachos ( Attah Chonen ) for two reasons: • We must ask for wisdom, for without it we are not capable of discern- ing between two things, such as the holy Shabbos and the mundane weekday. 278 • We may not ask for material needs on Shabbos, and this prohibition remains in effect until we have said Havdalah. Therefore, we say Attah Chonantanu first, and only then do we ask for our material needs. 279 If a person forgot to say Attah Chonantanu , he generally does not need to repeat Maariv , as he can rely on the Havdalah that he will say over a cup of wine. Repeating Maariv We will see that one is forbidden to eat or drink (except for water) before making Havdalah over wine. Chazal were strict in this regard, and so, if one did eat or drink and forgot to say Attah Chonantanu , he must repeat Shemoneh Esrei . 280 Furthermore, if one anticipates that he will be unable to make Havdalah, he must repeat Shemoneh Esrei if he forgot Attah Chonantanu . 281 Missing Maariv on Motzaei Shabbos Generally, if one forgets or is forced to miss a tefillah , he can make it up during the tefillah that follows. (Of course, one is forbidden to plan such a sce- nario, and he is not permitted to say a second Shemoneh Esrei if the omission was deliberate.) If this happened on Motzaei Shabbos, one must say two Shemoneh Esreis on Sunday morning. The first one fulfills his obligation for Shacharis , and the second one is the replacement for the missing Maariv . During the sec- ond one, if he has not already made Havdalah over wine, he must add in Attah Chonantanu . 282 Missing Minchah on Shabbos Similarly, if a person inadvertently missed Minchah on Shabbos, he says two Shemoneh Esreis during Maariv after Shabbos. The first fulfills his obligation of Maariv , and he adds in Attah Chonantanu . The second replaces the missing Minchah , and Attah Chonantanu is not said (the Shemoneh Esrei is the regular weekday one). 283",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"277. Mishnah Berurah  294:1.

77,09/10/2025,"MAARIV ON MOTZAEI SHABBOS,  CONTINUED","Vihi No’am As explained before, Maariv should be said slowly in order to delay the return of the wicked to Gehinnom. 284 Vihi No’am is not said before a week in which a Yom Tov falls out, as it is a request that Hashem bless the work of our hands, and we do not work on Yom Tov. If erev Pesach falls out on Friday or Purim falls out on any day of the week, Vihi Noam is said, as work is permitted on erev Pesach in the morning, and on Purim for the entire day. 285 The first verses of U’Va L’Tzion are omitted, as they deal with Redemption, and the Redemption will not occur at night. 286 V’Yitten Lecha and Gutt fun Avraham Many people say V’Yitten Lecha after Maariv . V’Yitten Lecha is a special tefillah made up of powerful verses, wherein we ask Hashem to bless our week physically and spiritually. One is also permitted to say it after Havdalah. 287 A mourner during shivah (the seven days following burial) does not say it. 288 Many people, especially women, also say a tefillah in Yiddish (although it has been translated into Hebrew as well) called Gutt fun Avraham . Havdalah in Shul Havdalah should be recited in shul for those that need it. It is a great mitzvah to provide the shul with Havdalah supplies. 289 However, those who need to make Havdalah for their families at home should not say it nor have the intention to fulfill their obligation with the shul Havdalah. 290 If one did, he may not say it for the women or children at home. 291 There is a custom to mention the name of Eliyahu HaNavi on Motzaei Shabbos, as he will hopefully bring the good news that Moshiach has arrived during the week to come. 292",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"284.

78,10/10/2025,HAVDALAH: THE CUP OF WINE,"Havdalah on Wine There is a dispute regarding whether Havdalah is a Torah mitzvah like Kid- dush, or a Rabbinic mitzvah . 293 All agree that once one has recited Havdalah during Maariv , saying it again over wine is a Rabbinic requirement. Havdalah is made in this order: the brachah of HaGafen on the wine, the brachah on the spices, the brachah on fire, and the brachah of HaMavdil . Changing the order does not invalidate the Havdalah. 294 All of the ideals that apply to a kos shel brachah (enumerated in Days__—26) apply to the cup of wine used for Havdalah as well. Both the one reciting Havdalah and those listening should focus their eyes on the wine or the candle (or the siddur, if necessary) to avoid being distracted. 295 OVERFLOWING THE WINE When pouring the wine, one should allow the cup to overflow because it is a sign of brachah (blessing) when wine flows in abundance. 296 Drinking the wine Upon the completion of Havdalah, one should drink from the cup before using the wine to extinguish the flame. As always, one should ideally sit when drinking the wine. 297 The minimum amount that one is required to drink is a cheekful. This can be shared among the listeners. Ideally, one should drink a full revi’is (3.3 ounc- es/97.5 milliliters___ ) in order to obligate himself in an after- brachah ( Al HaGe- fen ) according to all opinions. We have a tradition that women do not drink from the cup of Havdalah. Furthermore, it is preferable that the one who made Havdalah drink the whole cup, and not share it with the members of the household. 299 What to Make Havdalah On Havdalah should ideally be said over wine or grape juice. Wine or grape juice are greatly preferred for Havdalah, as Chazal teach that Hashem regards one who makes Havdalah with wine or grape juice as a fulfillment of am segulah mikol ha’amim___ — the choicest of all the nations. If one does not have any wine or grape juice, or one is not able to drink it, he can make Havdalah on chamar medinah (a socially respectable drink, based on what is normal for that place). (For more details and examples of chamar medinah , see Day__.) Unlike Kiddush on Friday night, one may not make Havdalah on bread. 301 Havdalah during the Nine Days Even though wine is prohibited during the first nine days of Av as we mourn the destruction of the Beis HaMikdash, the Shulchan Aruch rules that one may drink the wine of Havdalah. This is the custom of Sefaradim. 302 The Rama says that our custom is to give the wine to a child of chinuch age (above age six or seven years old) who participated in the Havdalah. This is the custom for Ashkenazim. Nevertheless, if no such child is available, one should drink it himself. 303 Moreover, this is preferable to using chamar medinah .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"293.

Spices When making the brachah on the spices, one should switch the spices to his right hand, and the cup to his left hand. One keeps hold of the cup during the blessings on the spices and the flame because all the blessings of Havdalah should be recited over wine. 305 Flame Before making the brachah on the flame, one should continue to hold the cup in his left hand, and reflect the light of the candle onto his right hand’s fin- gernails. He should then recite brachah on the flame. 306 We put our fingernails to the light before making the brachah because one first needs to see the item before making a blessing of praise on it. 307 Nevertheless, some people have the custom to make the brachah first and reflect their fingernails with their right hand only afterwards. This is also per- mitted, provided that the benefit from the flame was already available at the time that the brachah was made.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"304.

80,12/10/2025,HAVDALAH: STANDING OR SITTING,"If one is reciting Havdalah for only himself, he can stand. However, regarding one who is reciting it for others as well: • The Shulchan Aruch rules that one should sit, in order to create a situ- ation where all of those present are focusing themselves (known as a kvius ) for the mitzvah. Sefaradim generally follow this view. 308 • The Rama rules that one should stand, because Havdalah also serves to escort Shabbos out, and that is done while standing for the honor of Shabbos. Furthermore, being that all of those present anyway in- tend to do the mitzvah , the act of sitting is not necessary to join them together. 309 Ashkenazim generally follow this view, if there is no family custom already. The Vilna Gaon and the Chazon Ish both sat during Havdalah, whereas the Chofetz Chaim stood. Both views are valid, and one should follow the custom of his family. When the night after Shabbos is a Yom Tov, Havdalah is inserted into Kid- dush. In this instance, all agree that it is preferable to sit for the Kiddush-Ha- vdalah. 310 Priorities If one has only a small amount of wine, he should use it for Havdalah, and make Kiddush on bread instead. 311 If one has a small amount of wine and a sufficient amount of chamar medi- nah , Kiddush takes precedence for the wine, and Havdalah can be made over chamar medinah . 312",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"308.

81,13/10/2025,HAVDALAH: SPICES,"Why We Smell Spices Chazal understood the anguish experienced by the soul when Shabbos leaves. They recommended that one smell spices during Havdalah to restore and uplift it. 313 While it is ideal to have spices at Havdalah, because it is technically not an obligation, one need not expend great effort to obtain it if it is difficult to do so. 314 Weekday Versus Motzaei Shabbos___ During the week, the brachah on spices depends on the type of spice. • If it is an herb, one should recite: “. . . borei isvei besamim — Who created herb spices.” • If it is a tree, one should recite: ”. . . borei atzei besamim — Who created tree spices.” • If it is a fruit, one should recite: “. . . hanosein rei’ach tov bapeiros — Who gives a good smell to fruit.” • If it is a spice, one should recite: “. . . borei minei besamim — Who created all types of spices.” However, during Havdalah, the brachah is always Borei Minei Besamim , re- gardless of which of the above categories is being smelled. 316 Although all of the categories are fine for Havdalah, one should try use a true spice, for which the brachah of Borei Minei Besamim is anyway appropriate, such as cloves or cinnamon. Some Rules Regarding the Brachah Made on Spices One may only make the brachah on something that creates a nice smell, not on something that was intended to remove a bad smell, such as air freshener. 317 One can only use a substance that possesses an intrinsic smell. Thus, one may not use an empty spice container unless there is still some dust residue of the spices left in it. 318 One can only use something that still actually exists, not something that has been absorbed, such as sweet-smelling clothing or nice-smelling cream that is rubbed into skin. 319 However, one may make the brachah on a liquid that has absorbed the smell of the original spice, being that the liquid itself has a smell, and it came from a genuine source. 320 One should not use perfume, as it is likely to contain synthetic materials which do not have a real smell, and it may also contain substances that have bad smells within it. 321 One may not use those spices that non-Jews use at their festive functions. Chazal made this rule because their spices would often end up being used for avodah zarah (idolatry). However, if it is known that their spices are being sold on the market or used in cooking, it is permitted, though not ideal. 322",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"313. Brachos  51a.

82,14/10/2025,"HAVDALAH: SPICES, CONTINUED","Separate Container It is best to keep the spices used for Havdalah and those used for cooking in separate containers. 323 A glass or plastic container is preferable for Havdalah spices, as some wood- en or metal containers are known to emit bad smells over time. 324 If one must use cooking spices (which is not ideal), he must first pick up the spices to change their status into a mitzvah item. He may then proceed with Havdalah. Uncertain if the Spice Still Smells We almost always make brachos before doing a mitzvah or getting bene- fit. However, if one is not sure if the spice still smells sweet, he can and must smell the spices first, as it avoids a possible brachah l’vatalah (a brachah made in vain) in the event that the spice does not have a smell. If it does, in fact, have a smell, one makes the brachah and then smells it as normal. 325 Lacking a Sense of Smell One who has lost his sense of smell — temporarily or permanently — may not make the brachah . If he is making Havdalah for others, he should not make the brachah on spices for them, as he himself cannot smell. Rather, they should each make their own brachah on the spices. 326 Listening to Someone Else___ When one is listening to Havdalah, he does not make a new brachah before smelling the spices, provided that he had in mind to rely on the brachah of the one reciting it. However, if one does not manage to smell the spices before the speaker starts making the final brachah , he must concentrate on the speaker’s subsequent brachos and wait. Once all of Havdalah has been completed, he should make a new brachah on the spices and smell them. (This is also true for the brachah on flame.) ",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"323.

83,15/10/2025,HAVDALAH: THE FLAME,"The Reason On Motzaei Shabbos, we make a brachah on fire, because that was when Hashem inspired Adam HaRishon to create fire. 328 If One Does Not Have a Flame or Wine If one does not have a flame (we will clarify what is required), he still makes Havdalah. When a flame becomes available later that night, he can make the brachah on the flame at that point. 329 If one does not have a cup of wine to make Havdalah, but expects to be able to obtain it later that night, he should not make a brachah on the flame until he acquires the wine. He should then make Havdalah on wine, spices, and a flame as usual. 330 A “Torch” One should preferably use a wax candle. If he cannot, he should try to find something that does not have a bad smell. One should ideally use an “avukah ” — literally, a torch. Halachically, this refers to something that has two connecting flames. It follows that two candles whose flames are touching is fine. Similarly, two wicks that come out separately, but whose flames connect, is also fine. 331 Note that when Yom Tov falls out on Motzaei Shabbos, one should prefer- ably avoid using two separate candles. 332 Electric lights We mentioned that in certain cases, there are opinions that allow one to use electric lights for Shabbos candles, but since one needs a real light created through heat, only incandescent bulbs are acceptable. Regarding Havdalah, if one does not have a flame, there are Poskim who allow one to make the brachah on an incandescent bulb. 333 However, others hold that this is not ideal, as it is like a flame in a glass, which is problematic. 334 That being said, it is fine to look at the flame using one’s glasses, as the glasses are considered like the body of the person himself. ",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"327.

84,16/10/2025,"HAVDALAH: THE FLAME, CONTINUED","DERIVING BENIFIT As we mentioned previously, one may say the brachah once he is within range of benefiting from the flame. Benefit is determined by having enough light to theoretically differentiate one coin from another. This is why we have the custom to reflect the flame onto our fingernails — to get the same type of benefit, seeing the difference between fingernails and skin. Attached fingernails are also used here as a siman (sign) of blessing, as they never stop growing. 335 It is not necessary to turn off the electric lights. So long as one is in a position to derive benefit (whether the lights are on or off), he can make the brachah . Reflecting the fingernails is a custom, and if one cannot look at the reflection of his fingernails, the brachah can still be said if he is close enough to benefit from the flame. 336 REFLECTIN THE FLAME We mentioned that one holds the cup in his left hand and reflects the light onto his fingernails with his right hand. This is done by curling one’s fingernails into his palm, allowing all of the fingers and nails to reflect the light of the flame at the same time. 337 Some also have the custom to stretch their hands out, allowing the light to reflect off of the back of the hand afterwards. 338 Using a Flame That Was Lit on Shabbos One may not make the brachah on a flame that was lit on Shabbos. 339 It does not matter if it was lit by a Jew or a non-Jew, even if the non-Jew lit it for his own benefit. 340 If one made the brachah on a flame that was forbidden to be lit, his whole Havdalah is invalid, and he must make the HaGafen , Borei Me’orei HaEish , and HaMavdil brachos over. 341",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"335.

Rather, one must either put it out and light it again, or light a new flame from it. NOTE: As we said regarding spices, any candle lit from the party of a non-Jew is prohibited, as there is a likelihood that it was or will be used for idol worship. 343 In Order to Give Light The flame must be lit for the purpose of giving light, and not for any other purpose. 344 One is permitted to use coals that are still hot enough to cause a twig that touches them to ignite. However, as we have said, these coals must have been lit in order to give off light, not for cooking or warmth. Similarly, one may not make the brachah on a yahrtzeit candle (even if it was lit after Shabbos), because such a flame is for the honor of the dead, and not for light. 345 NOTE: The rules for the flame of Motzaei Yom Kippur differ from those of Motzaei Shabbos. A blind person may not make the brachah on a flame, as he is not able to benefit from it. However, he does recite the rest of Havdalah. 346 One can only make the brachah on the flame if he is able to see the flame and benefit from it. Therefore, a candle in a closed metal cylinder (with holes) will not work. It is even preferable not to use a candle in a closed glass cylinder. 347",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"342.

86,18/10/2025,HAVDALAH: WOMEN,"Are Women Obligated? There is a dispute whether women are obligated in the mitzvahof Havdalah. 348 On the one hand, it is a time-bound positive mitzvah, from which wom- en are usually exempt. However, women are obligated in such mitzvos that are related to Shabbos, as we have explained — because they are bound by the prohibitions of breaking Shabbos ( shamor ), they are therefore automatically included in the active positive mitzvos ( zachor ) such as Kiddush and lechem mishneh . As such, they should also be obligated in Havdalah. On the other hand, since Havdalah is only recited after Shabbos, it may not be regarded as a Shabbos mitzvah , and we would thus revert to the usual rule that they are exempt from time-bound positive mitzvos. The Halachah The Rama advises women to avoid this issue by hearing Havdalah from a man. 349 If There Is a Man Available Because of this, a man who plans to make Havdalah for a woman should have in mind not to fulfill his obligation with the shul’s Havdalah. In this way, he will still be obligated to make Havdalah when he gets home, and he can include any women while doing so. 350 Note: As we have often written, any time that one is fulfilling another person’s obligation, the one reciting must intend to carry out the mitzvah for the listener, and the listener must intend to fulfill the mitzvah through the one reciting. However, if the man has already fulfilled his Havdalah obligation, he may not make Havdalah on behalf of women, because it may be a brachah l’vatalah (a brachah made in vain) if women are not obligated. In such a case, he can only make Havdalah if there is a male above the age of chinuch (usually age six or seven) who needs to hear Havdalah. 351 If There Are No Men Available___ If there are no men (or she is unable to wait for them), a woman should perform the mitzvah of Havdalah herself. Because she has taken on the mitzvah , she is allowed to say Havdalah for herself even according to the view that she is not obligated. 353 Note that this obligates her only for that instance, and not for every Havdalah in the future. Although women generally do not drink from the cup of Havdalah, if a woman makes Havdalah herself she must drink the minimum of a cheekful, or else it will be invalid. As mentioned, it is preferable to drink a revi’is in order to be obligated in a brachah acharonah ( Al HaGefen ) according to all opinions. 354",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"348.

A Woman Making Havdalah for a Child Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach rules that a woman who has not yet heard Havdalah can make it on behalf of her son (of chinuch age), even though he definitely has a Rabbinic obligation, and her obligation is in doubt. 356 A Woman Making Havdalah for a Man Who Is Ill and Has Verbalized a Form of Havdalah In the same way, a woman can recite Havdalah for her sick husband who is unable to make Havdalah himself. However, he must first say the words “ Baruch hamavdil bein kodesh l’chol — Blessed is He Who distinguishes between the holy and the mundane.” In this way, he has fulfilled his Torah obligation of Havdalah, and his obligation to recite it over wine is only Rabbinic.

88,20/10/2025,EATING AND DRINKING  BEFORE HAVDALAH - SEUDAH SHELISHIS,"Seudah Shelishis We have seen that although one should preferably begin seudah shelishis (the third meal) before shkiyah (sunset), but one may wash and break bread until thirteen minutes after shkiyah , if necessary. This is the time limit in Eretz Yisrael, but it may vary from place to place. If one has started to eat (with bread) before shkiyah or within the permitted thirteen minutes thereafter, he may continue eating even if the time for Havdalah has arrived. The mitzvah of seudah shelishis nullifies the prohibition. 360 However, if one inadvertently started eating seudas shelishis after the permit- ted time, he must stop eating when the time for Havdalah arrives ( tzeis hako- chavim , which can be found in a luach ), and recite Havdalah before continuing. 361 Seudah Shelishis If one made sheva brachos at seudah shelishis , he is permitted to drink the wine. 363 However, the chassan (bridegroom) should preferably be the one to lead the zimmun , and therefore drink the cup. The chassan and the kallah (bride) should drink only the minimum cheekful of wine. 364 Latest time for Havdalah___ If a person unavoidably or mistakenly did not recite Havdalah on Saturday night, he must recite it as soon as possible. In any case, if he is able to make Havdalah and is being negligent in doing so, he may not eat until he does so. Havdalah can be recited until Tuesday afternoon, before nightfall. However, the brachos on spices and on a flame may only be recited until dawn on Sun- day morning. 366 The latest time for Havdalah following Yom Tov is before nightfall of the following day. If this occurs after Rosh HaShanah, in which case the next day is Tzom Gedaliah (a fast day), one may still make Havdalah and give the wine to a child to drink. 367 Note that when Tishah B’Av falls out on Saturday evening, we do not make Havdalah, although we do make the brachah on the flame. Rather, we only re- cite Havdalah on Sunday night at the completion of the fast (unless one is not fasting). 368",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"358. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  299:1.

One who does so for seudah shelishis is still bound by the prohibition to eat or drink before Havdalah, and may not drink the cup of wine.

90,22/10/2025,BEFORE AND AFTER HAVDALAH,"A Meal Following Havdalah If a person makes Havdalah and plans to drink wine during a meal that will immediately follow, he does not recite the after- brachah of Al HaGefen on the wine, and he does not make a new HaGafen on the wine that he drinks during that meal. 369 If one plans to eat bread immediately after Havdalah, he should not place the bread in front of him, or alternatively, he should cover it during Havdalah. This is because, as we explained regarding Kiddush, the brachah on bread generally receives precedence over the brachah on wine, and it is an embarrassment to the bread when one makes the brachah on wine first. (The wine is required first because one is forbidden to eat before Havdalah.) 370 Doing Melachah Before Havdalah Even after Shabbos leaves, one is not permitted to do any melachah , Torah or Rabbinic, 371 until Havdalah is recited. If there is a need to do melachah , he should either daven Maariv and include Attah Chonantanu , or say the phrase “ Baruch hamavdil bein kodesh l’chol — Blessed is He Who distinguishes be- tween the holy and the mundane.” 372 Note that merely saying “ Shavua tov ” is not good enough. 373 This is very important for women who do not usually daven Maariv — they must say this phrase before doing any melachah . This only allows melachah , but one may not eat or drink (except water) until Havdalah is recited on a cup of wine (even if one said Attah Chonantanu ). 374 Interestingly, one is permitted to move muktzeh objects before reciting Ha- vdalah, if necessary. 375 Folding the Tallis We will learn that a person is not permitted to fold his tallis on its creases on Shabbos. 376 Once one has recited Havdalah, it is meritorious for him to fold his tallis, for he is involving himself in a mitzvah immediately (especially if it is a Shabbos tallis, in which case he is performing the mitzvah of honoring the coming Shabbos).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"363.

This muscle never fully disintegrates and is the only physical part of the body that will exist until the time of techiyas hameisim (the resurrection of the dead). It follows that melaveh malkah is a crucial mitzvah. 383 Women There is a discussion among the Poskim whether women are obligated in melaveh malkah . Women should certainly try to perform this mitzvah , like all mitzvos related to Shabbos. 384 There is also an additional benefit for them: the No’am Elimelech teaches that it is a segulah (omen) for an easy childbirth. When the Vilna Gaon heard that his righteous wife had obligated herself to fast immediately after Shabbos (presumably as part of her desire for purity and repentance), he told her that eating melaveh malkah is better than fasting the entire week! ANOTHER BENEFIT In addition, Chazal also tell us that eating hot bread or drinking hot beverage at melaveh malkah benefits our health. Other Ways to Honor Shabbos as She Leaves Some also have the custom to “accompany” Shabbos on her way by having lit candles and singing the praises of Hashem and Shabbos following Havdalah. 385 Priorities Melaveh malkah is a mitzvah — a positive commandment. However, it is not classified as a chiyuv — an absolute obligation.

93,25/10/2025,GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF  HILCHOS SHABBOS:  TORAH AND RABBINIC PROHIBITIONS,"Before learning the detailed practical laws of Shabbos, we will mention some of the basic principles that govern them. Two Mitzvos The Torah says, “And on the seventh day, you must rest.” 387 It continues, “You shall not do melachah .” Thus, there are two mitzvos to keep regarding Shabbos: • To rest • Not to do melachah Like almost all prohibitions, women are also commanded to guard Shabbos. 388 What is Melachah? We will use the term “ melachah ” often. Although the literal translation of the word is “work,” it is clear that the Torah refers to more when it uses the word. 389 To emphasize this point: moving boxes from room to room all day is per- mitted from a Torah viewpoint and is not considered melachah___ (depending on certain factors, it may be a Rabbinic prohibition). And yet, to carry a needle from one’s house to the public domain is considered a melachah , and in the time of the Sanhedrin would carry the death penalty if the sinner had been sufficiently warned and there were valid witnesses to the act. If so, what is the Torah definition of melachah ? The term “ melachah ” refers to any creative activity that was required for the Mishkan (the portable Sanctuary used by Klal Yisrael to serve Hashem during their forty-year sojourn in the desert). There is a debate___ whether the activities relate to the actual building of the Mishkan___ or also to the processes required to bring the sacrifices in it. 393 Either way, these laws were taught to Moshe Rabbeinu on Har Sinai, and passed down all the way until today. Torah Prohibitions: Av and Toldah Every activity that was done in the same way and with the same intention as that done in the Mishkan is known as an av (literally, father), or main melachah . Any activity that is similar to a melachah , but is done differently, is known as a toldah — an offspring of the melachah . Both are Torah prohibitions. Here is an example of an av and toldah : • The actual melachah of zore’a (planting) is to place a seed in the ground. This was done in order to grow the plants that were used to make dyes that would be used in the Mishkan. • A toldah of zore’a is to pour water onto a plant, or to remove weeds from a field. Even though irrigating and weeding are not the same as planting seeds, the result is the same: causing plants to grow. 394 Two Levels of Prohibitions: Torah and Rabbinic Until now, we have discussed two types of Torah prohibitions which fall into either the category of av or that of toldah . However, there is another level of prohibition: a Rabbinic prohibition. This means that it does not meet all of the criteria of a Torah prohibition, but Chazal forbade it. Most Rabbinic prohibitions were enacted in order to protect one from transgressing the Torah prohibition. In certain instances, Rabbinic prohibitions allow for leniency. Even so, they are regarded with the same severity as Torah prohibitions when it comes to avoiding them. 395 We will discuss the criteria that are required for a Torah prohibition to be transgressed, and how, if they are not met, a forbidden action will become a Rabbinic prohibition.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"387.

If it does not meet certain criteria, it becomes a Rabbinic prohibition. We will now discuss the criteria that influence whether an act is a Torah prohibition or a Rabbinic one. Shinui or Kil’achar Yad — Doing an Activity in an Abnormal Way A Torah prohibition only occurs if the act is done normally. If one does the act in a strange manner, it changes to a Rabbinic prohibition. • If one cuts his nails with a nail clipper or scissors, he transgresses the Torah prohibition of gozez (shearing), because that is the normal way to cut nails. 396 However, if he bites them off or uses his hands to remove them, it is considered abnormal, and thus, a Rabbinic prohi- bition. 397 • If one is right-handed, and he writes two letters with his right hand, he transgresses the Torah prohibition of kosev (writing), because that is the normal way for him to write. However, if he uses his left hand to write, it is considered abnormal for him, and thus, a Rabbinic pro- hibition. 398 The abnormality has to take place during the actual process of the melachah , not before or after. • Putting a pot on the stove with one’s legs is abnormal, but the melachah that happens afterwards is unchanged, as the food in the pot will still cook (the Torah prohibition of bishul (cooking)). 399 Melachah SheEino Tzrichah L’Gufah — A Melachah That Is Done for a Different Purpose A Torah prohibition only occurs if one does the melachah for the same pur- pose that it was done in the Mishkan. If one does the act for a different purpose, it changes to a Rabbinic prohibition. • One who digs a hole in his house because he needs the hole, transgresses the Torah prohibition of boneh (building), because that was the purpose of digging for the Mishkan. However, one who digs because he needs the dirt (a different purpose from that of the melachah in the Mishkan) transgresses a Rabbinic prohibition. 400",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"396.

Eino Miskaven — Unintended Consequences A Torah prohibition only occurs if one intends that the melachah happen. However, one who does not intend to do the melachah , and has reason to believe that the melachah may not actually occur, may do the action (it is not even a Rabbinic prohibition). 401 • Plowing through sand in order to make a hole or a ditch is the Torah prohibition of choresh (plowing). However, dragging a table or chair because one needs it to be elsewhere (not for the purpose of creating furrows in the ground) is permitted, so long as there is a reasonable chance that a furrow will not occur. • Uprooting plants incurs the Torah prohibition of kotzer (harvesting). However, walking on grass simply because one needs to get somewhere (not in order to uproot it) is permitted if there is a reasonable chance that the grass will not be uprooted. 402 On the other hand, if it is very likely that the grass will be uprooted, such as when running or playing ball on the grass, it is prohibited. This is why playing sports on grass surfaces is usually Rabbinically forbidden on Shabbos. 403 Eino Miskayem — The Effect Does Not Last A Torah prohibition only occurs if one does a melachah that creates lasting results. That is, if a melachah can have long- or short-term consequences, the Torah prohibition is only transgressed if the action will last. If one does the same act, yet it will only produce a brief consequence, it becomes a Rabbinic prohibition. • Writing two letters on paper is the Torah prohibition of kosev (writing). However, when one writes on a steamed-up window or mirror, the let- ters will not last. Thus, the action becomes a Rabbinic prohibition. 404 • Tying a knot that stays closed is the Torah prohibition of kosher (tying). Tying a knot that will open easily is not a Torah prohibition, but it re- mains prohibited Rabbinically. 405 We will define what is considered lasting and what is not. If the act does not last for any time whatsoever, it is not considered a melachah at all, and is permitted outright. • Waving one’s fingers in the air to resemble letters and words does not create letters that have true existence, and is permitted. 406",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"401.

If one does a destructive or detrimental act, it becomes a Rabbinic prohibition. 407 • One who erases writing in order to write in that exact spot, transgresses the melachah of mochek (erasing). Similarly, one who erases writing because he does not want it to be read transgresses the melachah of mochek . 408 However, one who erases in order to destroy, such as by throwing the paper away into water, only transgresses the Rabbinic prohibition, because the act is destructive. 409 Grama — Causing a Melachah in an Indirect Way A Torah prohibition only occurs if the act that is done directly causes a melachah . However, if one does an action that will result in a melachah in the future — without actually directly doing the melachah — it is a Rabbinic pro- hibition. 410 • Throwing seeds into a mill where they will immediately get ground up is the melachah of tochen (grinding). But putting them into a place where they will eventually get ground up, but right now the mill is not on, is only a Rabbinic prohibition. 411 In certain cases (when a person may incur a loss, such as if something of value will get spoiled), a grama may be permitted. • If one’s cupboard caught fire, (assuming there is absolutely no risk to human life,) one is not permitted to extinguish it, because that is the melachah of mechabeh (extinguishing). 412 However, he is permitted to pour water on the other side of it so that the fire will not spread and may go out by itself, because he is merely causing an eventual melachah ( grama ), and Chazal were lenient when a loss might otherwise be in- curred. 413 Shnayim SheAsu — When More Than One Person Does the Melachah A Torah prohibition is only transgressed when it is performed by one per- son. If more than one person did it, it is not a Torah prohibition, but a Rabbinic one. Note that this applies only in a case where each person could have done the melachah by himself — but if the melachah required more than one person, both are guilty of a Torah prohibition. 414 • Lighting a fire is the melachah of maavir (lighting a fire). But if two peo- ple light a fire together, they have transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition because each one could have done it by himself. 415",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"407.

97,29/10/2025,"GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF  HILCHOS SHABBOS, CONTINUED:  PSIK REISHA","Psik Reisha — An Action Through Which A MELACHAH WILL DEFINITELY RESULT There is one type of action that although performed without specific intent for the melachah that arises (see Day__), is still a Torah prohibition. In the era before manufactured toys, parents would cut off the head of a chicken for their children to play with. This provides the name of an important principle in Hilchos Shabbos — psik reisha (literally, cut head). Intentionally killing an animal constitutes the melachah of shochet , however, in this case the parents did not aim to kill the chicken; rather, they simply wanted the head as a toy for the children. On the other hand, it is obvious that cutting off the head of a chicken will result in the death of the chicken every single time. This, says the Gemara, is a Torah prohibition. 416 Thus, when it is obvious that a melachah will occur (and, as we will see, the person will be happy that the melachah occurred) — even though one’s intention is not for the melachah itself, it is still deemed a Torah prohibition. 417 • One who pours water over grass or seeds in order to cause them to grow transgresses the Torah prohibition of zore’a (planting). If one washes his hands over the grass in his own garden, it is still a Torah prohibition, because it is obvious that doing so will result in irrigation, even though that is not his intention. 418 LO NICHA LEI - THERE IS NO BENEFIT FROM THE INEVITABLE MELACHAH There are cases of psik reisha that will not result in a Torah prohibition. Rath- er, they will have the status of a Rabbinic prohibition. If the resulting melachah result is not beneficial for the person, it remains a Rabbinic prohibition. 419 • Washing one hands in his own garden is a psik reisha , as it will definitely result in the melachah of zore’a , a Torah prohibition, and even though his sole aim is to wash his hands, it retains its Torah status. However, if one washes his hands in a stranger’s garden, or any garden that he has no interest in benefiting, it is a Rabbinic prohibition. 420 Psik Reisha D’Rabbanan Until now, we have only dealt with a psik reisha that results in a Torah melachah . If the inevitable outcome will result in a Rabbinic prohibition, the principle remains applicable: because the act will result in an inevitable Rab- binic prohibition, it is still prohibited (Rabbinically), even though the person’s intention is not for that result. • Trapping animals that are usually trapped (such as fish) is the Torah prohibition of tzad (trapping). Trapping animals that are not usually trapped (such as bees) is a Rabbinic prohibition. 421 If one covers a beehive in order to protect the bees from the elements, this will ob- viously result in them being trapped. Even though his intention is to protect the bees and not specifically to trap them, because the trapping is inevitable, it is prohibited, even where the underlying prohibition is Rabbinic. 422",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"416.

98,30/10/2025,"GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF  HILCHOS SHABBOS, CONTINUED:  RABBINIC ENACTMENTS TO GUARD  THE TORAH PROHIBITIONS","Rabbinic Prohibitions Until now, we have dealt with Torah prohibitions that lack certain criteria, and thus, are downgraded to Rabbinic prohibitions. However, there are certain acts that Chazal themselves prohibited, based on the Torah’s requirement to rest. 423 In some cases, they were concerned that an act was similar to a melachah , and in other cases, that it might lead to Torah prohibitions. The Torah gives Chazal the power to enact prohibitions when it says, “And make for Me a fence around my mitzvos” 424 and “Do exactly as they ( Chazal ) say.” 425 As we have emphasized before, it is absolutely forbidden to break a Rabbinic prohibition. The commentators write that true fear of Hashem can be found with those who keep the fences that were enacted by Chazal . 426 Similar to a Melachah Chazal saw fit to prohibit certain acts that resemble Torah prohibitions. In those cases, when the Torah said that an act is forbidden, Chazal understood that similar things should also be forbidden. • Rendering an unusable vessel or object into a usable one is an ex- ample of the Torah prohibition of makkeh b’patish (making an item usable). 427 Similarly, Chazal prohibited immersing vessels in a mikvah (known as tevilas keilim ) on Shabbos. Even though toveling does not effect a visible change, it does render a vessel that was unusable into a usable one. 428 • There is an obligation to take terumos and maasros from produce that grew in Eretz Yisrael. Until one has done so, these fruits or vegetables may not be eaten. Chazal prohibited taking terumos or maasros on Shab- bos because doing so renders the produce usable, and is therefore similar to makkeh b’patish . 429 May Lead to a Torah Prohibition Chazal saw fit to prohibit certain acts that would likely lead to a Torah pro- hibition. • One who picks a fruit off the tree transgresses the melachah of kotzer (harvesting). Chazal saw fit to prohibit climbing a tree because it is likely that one will break a branch or pick a fruit (the Torah prohibition itself) while doing so. 430 • One who squeezes the juice from olives or grapes transgresses the melachah of dash (extracting). Chazal saw fit to prohibit squeezing other fruits that are sometimes squeezed for their juice because it is possible that doing so will lead to squeezing olives and grapes (the Torah prohibition itself). Furthermore, Chazal prohibited use of the juice that came out from olives and grapes by itself, even if one did not squeeze it out. This is because permitting use of the juice would possibly lead to one squeezing the olives and grapes themselves to obtain more juice. 431",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"423. Shemos  23:12.

Certain acts are not melachos or even similar to them, nevertheless, Chazal prohibited them. This is based on the verse in Yeshayahu that lists several attri- butes of Shabbos, 432 from which Chazal expounded various prohibitions and mitzvos. We will discuss those actions that result in prohibitions here, and later in more detail (in Days___—414). Mimtzo Cheftzecha — Doing Weekday Activities It is Rabbinically forbidden for a person to delve into his weekday business activities on Shabbos. However, the verse says “ cheftzecha ,” meaning, “ your activities.” The implication is that delving into activities done for the sake of mitzvos is permitted. This is why there are certain leniencies for spiritual activities. 433 • Looking at a supplier’s business catalogue is not a melachah , and it is not similar to one. However, it is prohibited because one is delving into weekday business matters. 434 • In contrast, finding a rebbe to teach Torah to one’s children, even for payment, is permitted. This is because it is a spiritual activity. 435 (How- ever, one should not negotiate the exact amount on Shabbos.) 436 Daber Davar — Speaking about Weekday Matters Included in the same verse is the idea that one’s speech should be different on Shabbos from the rest of the week. Chazal learned that one may not speak about a melachah (or even a Rabbinically prohibited act___ ) that he plans to do after Shabbos. 438 Again, things relating to mitzvos are more lenient. • One is prohibited to say, “I’m going to build a house tomorrow.” Even though such speech is not a melachah , nor is it similar to a melachah , it is still prohibited because it involves speaking about doing a forbidden activity. • Discussing a future donation to tzedakah is permitted because it is a mitzvah. 439 Tirchah — Extra effort Chazal made certain that Shabbos would retain its identity as a day of rest. Thus, they saw fit to prohibit extraneous activity, unless it is extremely necessary. • Moving boxes out of a room is not a melachah , nor is it similar to one. However, it does not quite meet the idea of a “day of rest.” Therefore, depending on the quantities being moved, doing so may be prohibit- ed. 440 Again, for the sake of certain mitzvos, it is permitted, such as if one needs the space for visitors or to learn Torah. • Washing the dishes (with cold water) is not a melachah , nor is it similar to one. However, since Shabbos is a day of rest, Chazal ruled that one may only wash what is needed on Shabbos. 441 (Note that there are other issues regarding washing dishes that must be accounted for before doing so. These will be discussed in detail in Days___—170 and___.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"432. Yeshayahu  58:13.

Therefore, Chazal forbade both asking non-Jews to do melachah , and benefiting from melachah that they did for the benefit of a Jew (even without the Jew asking). 442 • A Jew may not ask a non-Jew to light a candle for him, nor may he benefit from the light of a candle that a non-Jew lit for him (even if he did not ask for it). 443 Even though the Jew did not do a melachah or anything similar to one, Chazal were concerned that it would lead to the Jew doing a melachah . Muktzeh Chazal saw fit to prohibit moving items that are otherwise used for weekday activities, even though it is not a melachah or similar to one. Their intention was to ensure that the Torah’s commandment of “You shall rest” 444 would be adhered to. They were also concerned that moving items that are usually used for melachah would lead to using them. 445 • A computer is muktzeh . Chazal were worried that moving such an item would go against the idea of resting, and also that doing so could lead to people using it. The topics of Non-Jews and muktzeh will be dealt with later in detail (see Days___—346 and___—385, respectively).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"442. Rambam,  Hilchos Shabbos  6:1.

This is despite the fact that the action is completely permitted and not a melachah at all. Nevertheless, Chazal were concerned that the onlooker would assume that an outright violation of the Torah is being committed. 446 (It is important to know that something prohibited because of maris ayin is also prohibited even when no one is looking, such as in the privacy of one’s home.) • One who washes clothing on Shabbos transgresses the melachah of melaben (whitening). Hanging up wet laundry to dry is not included in the Torah prohibition. However, doing so (even in one’s home) is Rabbinically prohibited, because an onlooker would think that the en- tire process of washing clothing (including the melachah ) was done on Shabbos. 447 Uvdin D’Chol (Weekday Activities) Chazal also prohibited actions that are not actually melachos but are done in a way that is similar to the way things are done on a weekday. This was instituted in order to protect the day of Shabbos by making it markedly different from the rest of the week. • Measuring or using measuring instruments on Shabbos is not a melachah . Nevertheless, Chazal prohibited it because it is a weekday activity. How- ever, they permitted measuring for a mitzvah or for one’s health. 448 This concludes the basic introduction to the halachos of Shabbos.

102,03/11/2025,INTRODUCTION (COOKING AND BAKING),"Introduction One of the most practical melachos encountered is that of bishul (cooking). 449 By definition, bishul is causing something to change its state in a significant way through the medium of heat. 450 Included in the prohibition are cooking___ and baking food___ even if the food was edible without being cooked or baked, and boiling a liquid, even if it was drinkable without being boiled. 453 • Cooking an apple is prohibited even though it was previously edible. • Boiling milk is prohibited even though it was previously drinkable. Melting something such as wax or even metal with heat is also included in the prohibition if it forms it into a different shape or causes it to get red-hot. 454 However, if heating something will not alter what may be done with it, it does not fall under the prohibition. • Pouring hot water onto a Kiddush cup in order to pry off some wax that had dripped on it from a Havdalah candle is prohibited. Howev- er, pouring hot water into a disposable plastic cup is permitted, even though it may soften it. 455 Using heat to dry something is also included in the prohibition. • It is forbidden to place a wet raincoat on or even near a heater. Creating another heat source — to the point where it can also cook other food or materials___ — is also included in the prohibition. • One may not place aluminum foil directly on top of the coils of a stove, as the foil will eventually get hot enough to cook food. Stopping a Potential Melachah Cooking is one of the few melachos that can take time. Only once something is actually Halachically cooked has one transgressed the Torah prohibition. 457 There- fore, if one mistakenly put a big pot of food that was not fully cooked on the stove to cook (which is prohibited), and realized before it actually finished cooking, he must remove it in order to avoid transgressing the Torah prohibition. 458",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"449. Although we will refer to this  melachah  as  bishul , which is cooking using liquid (boiling),  the  melachah  also includes  afiyah , which is cooking via dry heart (baking).
450. The exact details of how this takes place will be discussed.

103,04/11/2025,BISHUL: PROHIBITED HEAT SOURCES,"Torah Prohibition: Fire and Its Derivatives The Torah prohibition of cooking is transgressed by using fire and those things that derive their heat from fire, 459 because that is the normal way to cook. 460 However, any heat source that gets red-hot is also considered fire, such as an electric stovetop. • Cooking meat on a barbeque or gas stove falls under the Torah prohi- bition. • Cooking an egg in a pot of boiling-hot water that was just on the stove falls under the Torah prohibition. The Sun Cooking using the sun is permitted, as this kind of cooking is not normal, and is therefore not called cooking in a Halachic sense. 461 • Hanging an egg in the sun in the hope that it will cook is permitted. Rabbinic Prohibition: Derivatives of the Sun Additionally, Chazal prohibited cooking using anything that derives its heat from the sun, as it is very similar to something that derives its heat from fire. Even though cooking using the sun itself is permitted, they were con- cerned that onlookers may mistakenly think that heat derived from the sun actually came from fire. To avoid this, they prohibited cooking using heat that is derived from the sun. • Frying an egg on the hood of one’s car — that derived its heat from the sun — is Rabbinically prohibited. • Putting an uncooked meal into burning-hot sand so that it will cook is Rabbinically prohibited. 462 Microwave A microwave does not actually have a heat source. The microwave cooks by forcing the molecules within the food to move, creating heat. In theory, using a microwave should be permitted (barring the issue of using electricity). How- ever, we explained that anything that is the normal way to cook is included in the Torah prohibition. 463 Based on this, using a microwave to cook is forbidden from the Torah. 464",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"459.

104,05/11/2025,BISHUL: AT WHAT POINT  IS FOOD HALACHICALLY  CONSIDERED COOKED?,"Temperature at Which Cooking Can Happen The prohibition of cooking only applies when the heat is capable of caus- ing the food to become yad soledes bo , that is, the point at which one’s hand would reflexively pull away from a hot item it touches. 465 This is a Halachic term and not to be determined on one’s own. On a general basis, we assume that this is around___°F/43°C. 466 This is about the temperature of a hot bath for an adult, and probably slightly cooler than a cup of coffee or the water from a hot faucet. Cooking Liquids Liquids do not undergo a chemical change when heated. The point at which something has Halachically changed from cold to hot is yad soledes (109°F/43°C, as mentioned above). This is unlike solids, which we will discuss shortly. • When heating up cold soup, boiling it up to___°F/43°C incurs the Torah prohibition. Cooking Solids We explained that cooking means transforming something with heat. When it comes to solids, it takes longer for the food to get to the point of being edible, which is a significant enough change to incur the Torah prohibition. At what point does something become Halachically edible? The Gema- ra___ terms it “ maachal Ben Derusai ” — when it is barely edible, but edible enough that a criminal on the run would eat it. There is a dispute as to what point this is. The Rambam holds that something is edible enough for such a person when it is half cooked. 468 Rashi holds that it is already edible when it is one-third cooked. 469 On a general basis, we will follow the stricter opinion when there is a dispute over a Torah prohibition, such as in this case. 470 • If one boils a potato, he incurs the Torah prohibition when it is already one-third of the way to being cooked, like the stricter opinion. • We will learn that it is Rabbinically prohibited to leave an uncooked food on an uncovered stove before Shabbos. 471 Again, we follow the stricter opinion: when the correct permitted procedure is followed, one may still only put the food on the stove once it is half cooked. 472",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"465.

105,06/11/2025,BISHUL: SPEEDING UP  THE COOKING PROCESS - FOOD,"Food Is Maachal Ben Derusai or Liquid Is Yad Soledes We learned that one transgresses the Torah prohibition if he cooked a solid to one-third of usual, or a liquid to___°F/43°C. We will now see that cooking anything further (even minimally), is still a Torah prohibition, 473 until it has reached the point of being___ percent cooked. 474 • If one mistakenly removed a pot of soup from the flame before it had boiled, even if the soup is already___°F/43°C, he still may not put it back on the stove. Doing so is a transgression of a Torah prohibition. 475 • If one mistakenly removed a pot of chicken from the flame before it was fully cooked, even if it was already more than half cooked, he may not leave it near the flame so that it will cook further. Doing so is a transgression of a Torah prohibition. 476 Optimizing the Cooking Process Adding to or speeding up the cooking process also falls under the Torah prohibition. 477 • Putting a lid onto a pot of food cooking on the stove is a Torah pro- hibition, as it causes the food to cook faster. 478 This is true even if the pot was already removed from the fire, so long as the food wasn’t fully cooked (100 percent). 479 As a review, the two basic rules are: 1. Cooking anything from scratch, up until one-third in the case of a solid, or___°F/43°C with regard to a liquid, falls under the Torah pro- hibition. 2. Cooking anything that is not___ percent cooked still carries a Torah prohibition even if the added cooking is very minimal (for example, cooking it from__ percent to__ percent cooked). One is advised to make sure that all Shabbos food is fully cooked before Shabbos begins. 480",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"473. Biur Halachah  318:4, “ Shayach .”

106,07/11/2025,BISHUL: REHEATING SOMETHING  THAT IS FULLY COOKED,"We have learned that cooking anything that is not fully cooked carries a Torah prohibition, and that adding to or speeding up the cooking process is also prohibited by the Torah. We will now discuss reheating something cold that is already fully cooked. Solid (Dry) Foods A solid that has been fully cooked will not undergo a significant change when reheated. Therefore, reheating a solid, dry food is permitted. 481 However, we will see that there are conditions governing when, where, and what type of food and method one may use to reheat a food. • Putting a fully cooked schnitzel onto a pot that is on a covered stovetop is permitted. NOTE: We will learn the details of the requirements in order for a food to be considered Halachically “covered.” However, if any other uncooked food was added to the cooked item, it is prohibited to reheat it, as what was added is getting cooked for the first time. • If one put new spices that were never cooked before onto a fully cooked schnitzel, he may not reheat the schnitzel, as the spices are getting cooked for the first time (even if the requirements of a covered stove are met). The Same Method of Cooking One is only permitted to reheat food using the same form of heat that had cooked it originally. For example, if the food was boiled (heated in the medium of water), it is forbidden to bake it (heat it in an oven or the like), and vice versa. 482 This is because a change in the form of heat causes a significant change in the food. • One may not place croutons into a boiling pot of soup if they were originally baked, because they will now be boiled in the soup. (We will learn that in certain cases, one is permitted to dip challah into his bowl of soup, even though the challah was baked (dry), and is now being boiled in the soup (wet). 483 Liquids However, a fully cooked liquid that cools down may not be reheated, because doing so will cause a significant change in the food. • One may not take a pot of soup that has cooled down completely and place it on a stove (even if it is Halachically covered) to warm up, be- cause he is significantly changing it from cold soup to hot soup. However, if it still retains some of its warmth and would be drunk that way, 484 one may still reheat a liquid. 485 • If some coffee remained in a cup and still has some of its warmth and would still be drunk that way, one may pour hot water into it to reheat it. Even though reheating liquids is usually prohibited, since the remaining coffee did not cool down completely, and one would still drink it as is, it is not considered a significant change. We will discuss the ramifications of these halachos shortly.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"481. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  318:4.

107,08/11/2025,BISHUL: HOW TO REHEAT - FOOD,"Food Up on Shabbos Even when one is permitted to warm something up (in the cases we have enumerated above), he may not put it directly on the fire (even if it is covered). Chazal prohibited this for two reasons: 1. Once the food is on the fire, one may decide to increase the heat, which is a melachah in its own right. 486_. To the onlooker, putting food onto a heat source appears to be like cooking, known as mechzi k’mevashel . 487 Therefore, in order to warm something up: 1. One must make sure that the flame or heat source is covered. Some Poskim also recommend that one also cover the dials that control the heat. 488 Therefore, a stove should be covered with the metal sheet that we call a “ blech .” This sheet also covers the burners, which are the heat source. A hot plate or tray are already manufactured with a cover on, and thus do not require a further cover. 489 But some Poskim still rule that it must be covered with aluminum foil that is thicker than normal, and if there are dials, they should also be covered. 490_. Even once the heat source is covered, one may not put the food di- rectly on the cover (i.e., on the blech that sits on the stove, or on the foil-covered hot plate). 491 There are two options regarding where to put the pot: 1. One should place the pot or container that he wishes to reheat on top of another pot that has food in it and that was already on the blech from erev Shabbos . 492 One may not put it on an empty pot. 493_. Another option is to take another vessel, pan, or foil container, and turn it upside down on top of the covered surface. One may then place the pot that he wishes to reheat on top of it. 494 • If one wishes to reheat a pot of dry, cooked meat and potatoes, he must have a stove that is covered with a metal sheet, or a hot plate (preferably covered with thick foil). One can either put it on top of a “full” pot that was already there from before Shabbos, or put it onto an upside-down container that is on the cover. (One is permitted to place a cover on the stove/hot plate on Shabbos, and to place the empty pot or other vessel upside down on the cover.) Potential Meat and Milk Issues Keep in mind that a pot with meat that has wet residue or steam emanating from under it will Halachically transfer “meaty flavor” to a pot that it touches below it. 495 Thus, one should preferably only place meaty vessels on meaty vessels, and milky vessels on milky vessels. If this is not possible, one must make sure that the pot is dry at the bottom, and preferably separate the pots with a foil barrier. • If one places a pot of cooked meat onto an urn, any wetness at the bot- tom of the pot will Halachically transfer “meaty flavor” to the urn, ren- dering the urn a meaty vessel. If that happens, one may be forbidden to use the hot water in his dairy coffee cup. To prevent this, one should make sure that the surface of the pot is dry, and that there are no holes that connect the two vessels with steam. Also, one should preferably place a piece of foil between them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"486. Mishnah Berurah  253:87.

108,09/11/2025,BISHUL: APPLYING  THE PRINCIPLE OF REHEATING - BREAD,"Bread is baked using dry heat. Putting bread into a hot pot of soup that had been on the fire ( kli rishon ) is considered cooking it, and is prohibited. Even if one poured the soup directly into a second pot ( kli sheini ) and put bread into that, it would still be considered cooking it, and is thus prohibited. 502 However, we generally dispense soup from a pot using a ladle, and thus, there are three vessels: the original pot ( kli rishon ), the ladle___ ( kli sheini ), and the bowl ( kli shelishi ). Once the hot soup is in such a bowl ( kli shelishi ), one is permitted to dip challah into it, even though it will “cook” something that has been baked, as we have stated above. However, if one left the ladle in the original pot for a long time, the ladle cannot be considered a kli sheini , so one should not dip the challah in the soup in his bowl. 504 Roasting a Cooked",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"496.

109,10/11/2025,BISHUL: APPLYING  THE PRINCIPLE OF REHEATING - FOOD,"Food One may not place boiled noodles or cooked chicken onto an upside-down or full pot on a covered hot plate to dry them out and give them a roasted fla- vor. 505 However, it is permitted to put them on in order to warm them up if they will be removed before drying out, as that is not considered roasting. 506 Note that chicken baked in an oven (in its own juices or gravy) is the subject of a dispute as to whether it is considered cooked or baked. 507",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"505. Mishnah Berurah  318:41.
506. Chazon Ish  37:14; Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in  Me’or HaShabbos  8:12.
507. It is common to put chicken in an aluminum pan with water and spices, and let it cook. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv held that this is considered roasting or baking (i.e., dry heat), as that is what  causes the cooking. However, the  Mishnah Berurah  (318:41), the Chazon Ish, and Rav Moshe  Feinstein hold that it is considered cooking, because the liquid imparts a flavor of something  cooked, and not roasted or baked, and without it, the chicken would dry out. It would seem that  according to this opinion, the cooking method is through liquid, and therefore and one may not  dry-bake it on a hot plate if it will dry out."
110,11/11/2025,BISHUL: KLI RISHON AND KLI SHEINI,"We mentioned that there are different rules depending on how far removed from the stove a vessel is. We will now elaborate: On the “Flame” (Heat Source) One must never ever put anything directly onto an oven, stove, 508 or hot plate on Shabbos, even if it is a cooked or dry solid (as it appears to the onlooker like cooking). One may only reheat a cooked food according to the rules mentioned pre- viously: using the same type of heat source, with the heat source covered, and on an upside-down or full pot. 509 Kli Rishon A pot that was cooking on the heat source that is still yad soledes (109°F/43°C) will cook raw food or cold liquid even if it is no longer on the stove. 510 Such a pot is known as a kli rishon . One who places food inside it transgresses the Torah prohibition of cooking. 511 • One may not remove a pot of soup from the stove and add parsley (neither fresh nor dry) to it. However, one may add a cooked food into a kli rishon that was removed from the heat source___ (so long as it is the same form of heat that it was cooked with). • One may take pieces of last night’s cooked chicken (we regard it as being “cooked” in the gravy) and add it to a cholent pot that has just been removed from its heat source. (One may only add the pieces, and not any excess gravy. 513 ) Kli Sheini A pot that contains what was poured from a kli rishon is known as a kli sheini . Not Easily Cooked Even if the kli sheini is yad soledes , one may generally put something that is not easily cooked inside of it. • If one poured water from an urn ( kli rishon ) into a cup ( kli sheini ), and now wants to reduce the temperature of the water in the cup, he may add cold water to it, as water is not considered an item that cooks easily. 514 Easily Cooked However, Chazal enumerated certain fresh items (such as small fish like sardines or eggs) that are quick to be cooked. 515 They ruled that placing such a food into a kli sheini will also be considered cooking, and is thus forbidden. • One may not pour water from an urn ( kli rishon ) into a pot ( kli sheini ) and place an egg inside to soft-boil it. Although such a pot is a kli sheini , eggs cook easily, and Chazal prohibited it. (We will discuss this concept in detail later.) • One may not put a piece of lemon into a cup ( kli sheini ) of hot water from an urn, as it is easily cooked. What Is Easily Cooked? The Mishnah Berurah holds that Chazal were merely giving examples of items that cook easily, and their list should not be considered comprehensive. 516 Therefore, it states that we should assume something will be cooked in a kli sheini unless it is clearly not easily cooked. Thus, we should refrain from putting anything uncooked or cooked in a different way into a kli sheini . 517 • One may not put honey into a cup ( kli sheini ) that has hot water from an urn, as it may cook easily. 518",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"508.

We usually rule according to the  Mishnah  Berurah , and in this case, so does Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.

111,12/11/2025,BISHUL: KLI SHELISHI;  MAKING TEA,"When the contents of a pot that was on the fire ( kli rishon ) are poured into another vessel ( kli sheini ), and again into a new vessel, this vessel is called a kli shelishi — the third vessel. In most cases, one can put foods into a kli shelishi even though it is still yad soledes . 519 • One may pour water from the urn into a cup, and from there into an- other cup ( kli shelishi ), and place a piece of lemon inside of it. However, according to most Poskim , food that obviously cooks easily may not be placed even into a kli shelishi . • One may not pour water from the urn into a bowl, and then into another bowl ( kli shelishi ), and place an egg inside of it, because an egg is very easily cooked. When there are mitigating factors, even foods that obviously cook easily may actually be placed into a kli shelishi . 520 • One may dip challah into a bowl with hot soup that was served from the pot using a ladle ( kli shelishi ). 521 Although challah is easily cooked, we are lenient because it was baked previously. See Day__. • One may pour hot water from the urn into a cup, and then into a second cup ( kli shelishi ), and add baked coffee powder. Although coffee powder is easily cooked, we are lenient because it was baked previously. 522 The Tea Bag A tea bag cooks immediately and should not be put into a kli shelishi . 523 The Mishnah Berurah recommends preparing tea essence concentrate before Shabbos (boiling tea leaves or bags and allowing them to soak in water). Af- ter they are “cooked,” one must strain out the tea leaves or remove the bags. Then, on Shabbos, the remaining tea essence concentrate may be poured into a cup that has water from the urn ( kli sheini ). As explained previously, water does not cook easily, and therefore may be poured into a kli sheini even though it is cool.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"519. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:63. Note that  Mishnah Berurah  318:39, in discussing mak- ing tea, does not suggest using a  kli shelishi . This implies that with obvious  kalei habishul , we still  consider it able to cook. Similarly, in 318:47, the author only brought the Pri  Megadim  that is  lenient regarding bread.
520. Although reheating using a different form of heat is prohibited, it is actually the subject  of a dispute. We rule strictly, but where there is another factor, we may be lenient. Thus, in a  kli  shelishi  where there is a doubt if it can cook at all, coupled with a previously cooked item, we are  lenient. Challah is baked, so we are lenient regarding putting it in a  kli shelishi . If the coffee powder  is baked, we are lenient regarding placing it in a  kli shelishi .
521. Note that one may not serve from a pot that is still on the heat source. If one did so, the soup  in the ladle is definitely still considered a  kli rishon .

523. Ibid. 1:63. Note that Rav   Moshe Feinstein in  Igros Moshe ,  Orach Chaim  4:74:15 holds that  a  kli shelishi  never cooks, and if so, a tea bag would be permitted."
112,13/11/2025,BISHUL: POURING,"We have seen that the halachos of a kli rishon are very strict, the halachos of a kli shelishi are very lenient, and using a kli sheini should be avoided unless something is known not to cook easily. We will now discuss whether pouring from a kli rishon retains the status of a kli rishon , or if it will be downgraded to a kli sheini . We will also have the same question regarding the status of something pouring from a kli sheini : will it be considered like a kli sheini or a kli shelishi ? Pouring from a Kli Rishon Pouring directly from a kli rishon will cook any food that the liquid is poured onto. 524 It is considered just like the kli rishon itself, and therefore, pouring onto an uncooked food (or a cooked food that was cooked in a different way) is forbidden. • It is forbidden to pour directly from an urn onto uncooked spices be- cause it is considered cooking. 525 • All cups, mugs, bowls, baby bottles, and plates must be dry before pour- ing anything hot (more than___°F/43°C) into them from a kli rishon . 526 • Because of condensation, droplets form on the lid of a hot pot. These droplets get cold quickly. One must be careful not to put the lid onto a hot kli rishon because doing so is considered cooking. Even regarding something that was previously cooked (albeit in a different form), pouring onto it directly from a kli rishon is forbidden. • It is considered cooking to pour water from an urn___ directly onto coffee powder in a cup. 528 Similarly, even if a liquid was previously boiled, and has now completely cooled down, pouring water from a kli rishon directly onto it is forbidden. 529 • Even if one prepared tea essence before Shabbos, one may not pour onto it directly from an urn if it is currently cool. Pouring from a Kli Sheini Because the contents of a kli sheini have already cooled down somewhat, 530 pouring from it will have the status of a kli shelishi . 531 Therefore, it is permitted to pour from a kli sheini onto any item that is known not to cook easily, or onto something that has already been cooked (even in a different way). • One may put coffee or milk into a cup, and pour onto it from a kli sheini, i.e., a cup with hot water that was dispensed from an urn. • But one should not put a tea bag into a cup and pour on to it from a kli sheini , as it cooks easily. 532 As explained, a tea bag cooks immediately, and should not even be used in a kli shelishi .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"524.

526. However, pouring onto insignificant drops of previously cooked liquid is not a problem.
527. Note that the Chazon Ish was concerned that something dispensed from something still  attached to the heat source will remain a  kli rishon  even in the second vessel ( Taamei D’Kra ,  Hora’os  M’Chazon Ish  11). Most other  Poskim  are lenient.
528. Note that the food will not be prohibited if it was already cooked, albeit through a different  form of heat ( Biur Halachah  318:10, “ Assur .” Also, it will still be permitted if the stream of water  was not an unconnected stream when it hit the food ( Mishnah Berurah  318:74), even if the food  had never been previously cooked.

114,15/11/2025,BISHUL: FOODS  THAT RETAIN HEAT (GUSH),"In general, we remove food from a pot using a spoon and put it onto a plate in order to eat it. The plate is thus usually a kli shelishi , and so there is less concern that any cooking will take place. However, certain foods, such as hot potatoes or pieces of meat, still retain much heat even after being placed onto a plate. Therefore, we ideally regard them as a kli rishon — we assume that these hot items can still cook no matter where they are. 533 Other examples of these types of foods include dry rice___ and noodles, 535 though they do not retain heat as long as potatoes. • If one places a hot potato onto a plate, and there is salad on that plate, he should avoid allowing them to touch, because fresh tomatoes and onions can cook and will not be ruined by the heat of the potato. 536 This is regardless of the number of vessels that the potato passed through on its way from the pot to the plate, as long as the potato is yad soledes . • One may not pour cold mushroom sauce or tomato sauce onto a hot potato, even if it is on a kli sheini or kli shelishi . 537 This is because cold sauce, butter, 538 and tomato sauce___ are liquids, and reheating them is considered cooking. We are, however, lenient with placing a dry solid on such heat retaining items, even if they were originally heated in a different form, such as sugar or salt. 540 • If one has a hot potato on a kli sheini or kli shelishi , he may put salt on it. Salt has already been cooked, and we can therefore be lenient. 541",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"533. Mishnah Berurah  318:65.

116,17/11/2025,BISHUL: LIDS AND LADLES,"Covering a Pot on the Heat Source Although we learned that inserting a spoon into or stirring the food in a pot that is on the heat source is forbidden even if the food is fully cooked, putting a lid on a pot is permitted so long as the food is fully cooked. It is preferable to remove the pot from the heat source first before putting on the lid — but one must not let go of the pot, and also be sure only to return it to a heat source that is covered. 548 • If the fully cooked soup is boiling on the heat source, one is permitted to cover it with a lid. Covering a Pot That Has Been Removed from the Heat Source Needless to say, putting a lid on a pot of fully cooked food that is not on a heat source is permitted. However, one should be careful not to tilt the droplets of condensation on the underside of the lid back into the kli rishon or even put the lid back on the pot without drying the droplets, as the water will cook. A Ladle That Has Cooled Down One generally removes the pot from the heat source, inserts a ladle, and distributes the food. If, after the first usage, the ladle is left on the side, it may cool down completely. If one would then insert it back into the soup (which is still a hot kli rishon ), the cold soup that remained on the ladle from the previous distribution will get cooked again, and this is prohibited. 549 This is because, as we have explained, cooking a liquid that has cooled down is considered cooking. To solve this issue, some are stringent to wipe down and dry the ladle. How- ever, most Poskim___ hold that it is sufficient to shake off any excess soup.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"547.

117,18/11/2025,BISHUL: WARMING UP COLD FOOD,"We have seen that cooking solid food up to one-third cooked ( maachal ben Derusai ) or liquid up to___°F/43°C ( yad soledes ) or more, is a Torah prohibi- tion. We have also seen that one may never put anything directly onto a heat source, even if it is covered. Near a Covered Heat Source Chazal enacted a Rabbinic prohibition of placing an uncooked food or liquid in a place where it is capable of reaching yad soledes or one-third cooked. They were concerned that a person would forget to remove it before it reaches that point, ultimately transgressing the Torah prohibition. 551 • One may not place a frozen challah near a blech or covered hot plate if the ice particles that are on it will reach___°F/43°C. 552 • One may not leave a cold cup of soup next to a blech or covered hot plate if it is likely to reach___°F/43°C, even if he plans to remove it before that point. (In a case of great need, one should consult a Rav .) 553 Near a Kli Rishon This prohibition also applies to putting an uncooked food in or near a hot kli rishon that is capable of getting it to one-third cooked or yad soledes , even though it has been removed from the heat source. 554 • One may not place a plastic cup of water near a hot pot of noodles that has been removed from the heat source, if the water could eventually reach___°F/43°C. If One Did (B’Dieved) If by mistake, one did leave something where it may get cooked, he may still eat it as long as it was removed before it reached one-third cooked (solids), or___°F/43°C (liquids). 555 If It Is Not Possible to Reach One-Third (Solids) or___°F/43°C (Liquid) If the uncooked solid will not reach one-third of being cooked, or the liquid will not reach___°F/43°C even if it will stay there throughout Shabbos, one may place it near a heat source. • One may place a container of ice cream far away enough from a blech or covered hot plate that it will soften slightly and be easier to serve, yet will never reach___°F/43°C. 556 These prohibitions apply only where the Torah’s definition of cooking ap- plies. Thus, one may place uncooked food in the sun even if it will reach one- third cooked, as cooking via the sun is not considered cooking, and is therefore permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"550. Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in  Me’or Shabbos  1:4:29.

118,19/11/2025,BISHUL: HOT WATER FROM THE  FAUCET;  BOILERS;  SOLAR HEATERS;   HUMIDIFIERS; VAPORIZERS,"The Hot-Water Faucet___ As one turns on the hot-water faucet, cold water automatically flows into the boiler. The likelihood is that the boiler is constantly full of hot water that is heat- ed by an element, making it a kli rishon . If so, using the hot-water faucet causes cold water to get cooked, and doing so on Shabbos incurs a Torah prohibition. Therefore, one must ensure that only the cold faucets are used on Shabbos. If one has a single faucet handle that rotates, he must ensure that it is fully on the cold side. If One Has Already Turned On the Hot Water On the one hand, if one turns off the tap, it will definitely cook the water that has just gone into the boiler even more, thus extending the aveirah . On the other hand, if he leaves the faucet on, new water will come in, and be cooked in turn. Therefore, the Poskim say: • In all cases, it is best to hint to a non-Jew to turn the tap off. 558 • Where there isn’t a non-Jew available___ : If the water in the boiler is very hot already, it is better to shut the faucet off, and avoid the cooking of new water. However, if the water in the boiler is not very hot (even if it is higher than___°F/43°C), it is better to leave the water running until the water feels cool, and shut it only then. Note that one who has a gas-based system will not even be able to turn off the tap, as generally, turning on the faucet ignites the gas to heat the incoming water, and closing the faucet extinguishes it, which constitutes a melachah in its own right. Solar Heating We learned that the Torah prohibition of cooking only involves fire or some- thing that derives heat from fire (gas or electricity). In addition, we learned that Chazal prohibited using something that derives heat from the sun (such as a pan that has been outside in the sun). It follows that opening the hot-water faucet of a solar-powered boiler is Rabbinically prohibited since the incoming cold water will be heated up by something that derives its heat from the sun. However, with regard to solar heating, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on hot water for the benefit of a sick person or a baby. 560 Regarding asking a non-Jew to turn on the hot water of an electric boiler, one should consult a Rav . 561 HUMIDIFIERS Cold-Water Humidifiers A cold water humidifier takes cold water and sprays it as a mist. Assum- ing that this is how the machine works, one is permitted to add water to it on Shabbos. 562 One must be certain that this is indeed how the machine functions. Hot-Water Humidifiers One who adds cold water to a hot-water humidifier incurs a Torah prohibi- tion, as the cold water will be heated by the machine. Even adding boiling water is prohibited, as that water may cool down com- pletely in a separate compartment before flowing into the hot-water receptacle. Even if the water would flow directly into the hot-water receptacle, it is anyway forbidden (at least Rabbinically) to place anything directly on a heat source. However, one who is ill to the point of needing bed rest may tell a non-Jew to add water to it. One should consult a competent Rav to clarify the circum- stances of this exception. 563",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"557. Orchos Shabbos  1:99.

119,20/11/2025,BISHUL: IF FOOD WAS COOKED ON  SHABBOS (A TORAH PROHIBITION) - FOOD,"Food That Was Intentionally Cooked If one cooked food on Shabbos, knowing that it was Shabbos and intending to nonetheless transgress the Torah prohibition, that food is prohibited to him forever. Other people may only eat it after Shabbos has ended. It does not matter if he cooked it for them or not. 564 If he sold the food, the money is permitted since the penalty for his trans- gression is limited to the food and not to what emerges from it. Note that this rule also applies to nearly every other object that was im- proved by a melachah on Shabbos. 565 • If a person knowingly and intentionally put a potato into the oven on Shabbos, and it reaches one-third of being cooked, he may never eat that potato. Other people may eat that potato only after Shabbos has concluded. 566 Even if the food is added to a much larger amount of food that is already cooking, and is such a small proportion of the new combination that it would normally be nullified in the mixture, it remains prohibited until after Shabbos (and the prohibition extends to the food that it disappeared into). 567 • If one knowingly and intentionally added cold water to an urn on Shab- bos, the water in the urn is forbidden to others for the duration of Shab- bos, even though it would generally be considered a negligible addition to the existing water in the urn. The utensils in which the food was cooked also become forbidden for the same length of time as the food itself. Therefore, if it is forbidden forever to eat the food, then the pot will also be forbidden until one kashers it appropriately. 568 • A person who knowingly and intentionally put a raw cholent on the flame on Shabbos may never eat that cholent. Others may only eat it after Shabbos has concluded. The pot may not be used to cook in until after Shabbos for other people, and it may never be used by the sinner himself until it is kashered appropriately. It is worth noting that the likelihood of someone knowingly and intention- ally transgressing Shabbos is small. The situations described in the next section regarding unintentional transgressions are much more common. Food That Was Unintentionally Cooked There are two main types of mistaken transgressions. One is when the person thought that the action he was doing is permitted, when in truth it is forbidden. The second is when the person knows the action is forbidden but he forgot that it was Shabbos. In general, if food is cooked on Shabbos unintentionally or unknowingly, it is forbidden to the one who cooked it and to other people until Shabbos concludes. 569 There are many circumstances that allow for leniencies, such as a time of need. Therefore, one should consult a competent Rav if this question arises. 570 • If one turned on the flame under the cholent, thinking that Shabbos had not yet arrived, it is forbidden for everyone to eat it until after Shabbos. If they have nothing else to eat, he should consult a Rav . Keep in mind that simply being ignorant of the halachah and resolving to be lax anyway is Halachically considered intentional. One is required to ask or look up the halachah whenever there is any kind of doubt. However, if one is certain that something is permitted when it really is not, such an act is consid- ered unintentional. Two Exceptions No Visible Change If there is no visible change, then an unintentional transgressor is permitted to use it immediately. An intentional transgressor will be permitted to use it after Shabbos (it is not prohibited to him forever). 571 • If someone carried an object from a private house to a public square (if the public square qualifies as a Halachic public domain), which is the Torah transgression of hotzaah, he is permitted to use it after Shabbos if the act was intentional, and even on Shabbos if the act was unintention- al, because there was no visible or effective change in the object itself. 572 A Transgression That Is the Subject of a Dispute In many instances, if there is a dispute regarding the prohibition of an act, even if we rule that it is prohibited, the food will not be prohibited (to anyone) from such an act. 573 • Although we rule that reheating a liquid that has cooled down complete- ly is forbidden, it is actually the subject of a dispute. If one erroneously reheated a previously cooked liquid, he is permitted to drink from it. These rules apply to the transgression of a Torah prohibition only.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"564. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  318:1.

What is considered fully cooked? Ideally, before Shabbos begins, one should ensure that the food is in a state that any further cooking would actually begin to ruin it. 578 However, if necessary, one may be lenient if it is half cooked before Shabbos. 579 In cases of need, one may even be lenient if it is only one-third cooked before Shabbos. 580 • This is very applicable regarding an urn. Leaving water in an urn before Shabbos is essentially leaving an uncooked liquid on an uncovered fire — the Rabbinic prohibition of shehiyah . Therefore, ideally, one should ensure that the water is boiling before Shabbos. If necessary, the water should have at least reached___°F/43°C ( yad soledes ). 581 • One must ideally ensure that the entire cholent is fully cooked before Shabbos and would only get worse if it would be left on the uncovered stove.

122,23/11/2025,BISHUL: LEAVING UNCOOKED FOOD  ON A HEAT SOURCE,"We have seen that Chazal prohibited leaving uncooked food on an uncov- ered fire before Shabbos because one may come to make it bigger, a Torah pro- hibition. We also saw that it is permitted once the food is fully cooked, or even only one-third cooked, if necessary. We will now discuss another leniency: one may significantly reduce the heat of the fire or do something that makes it clear that one has no intention or need to continue cooking. 582 Cooking with Hot Coals In the past, people would leave the pot on a heap of hot coals before Shab- bos. But Chazal only allowed them to do so once the coals were either removed (significantly reducing the heat) or covered with ash (reducing heat and making it clear that no further cooking will take place). Today, we do not usually cook this way for Shabbos. Let us discuss our cooking methods. Stoves and Hot Plates That Have Knobs Stoves (both gas and electric) and hot plates that have knobs are Halachi- cally treated like a fire with coals. Therefore, one may not leave an uncooked food on them before Shabbos. Instead, in the case of stoves, one must place a thick metal sheet — known as a blech — on top of the flames or elements in order to significantly reduce the heat. 583 • If one put all of the ingredients for soup into a pot, he may not leave the pot to cook on an uncovered stove before Shabbos. Instead, he must put a thick metal sheet on top of the stove, and only then place the pot on top of it. A blech removes the need to cover the knobs. 584 However, some Poskim rec- ommend covering the knobs anyway. 585 However, merely covering the knobs without covering the stove with a blech is not adequate. In the case of a hot plate that has knobs, one should cover the hot plate with a sheet of thick foil. 586 It is not necessary to cover the knobs. 587 However, some Poskim recommend it anyway. 588 Adjusting the Flame After Covering the Flame with a Blech Once the blech has been placed on the stove, one should not adjust the flame or turn it on or off. This would defeat the purpose of the blech — which is to show that the heat has been reduced, and as a reminder not to increase the heat. If the flame needs to be adjusted, one should do so before putting the blech on it. 589 The same applies to a hot plate with knobs. Placing a Blech on Shabbos We will learn that one may take off and return cooked food that was on the flame on Shabbos, under certain conditions. The Shulchan Aruch rules that one who discovers that his food is burning may take off the pot, put a blech on the flame, and return the pot onto it (under certain conditions). It is clear that one may place a blech on the flame on Shabbos. 590 However, this is only if the blech will not get red-hot. If it would, it is forbidden under the melachah of maavir — lighting or strengthening fire.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"582. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  253:1.

123,24/11/2025,"BISHUL: LEAVING UNCOOKED FOOD  ON A HEAT SOURCE, CONTINUED","Ovens The heating elements in an oven are essentially impossible to cover, yet the knobs make it easy to adjust the heat inside of it. Therefore, one may not leave uncooked food inside an oven before Shabbos unless he has a metal insert (such as a box) or a cover for the elements, and the knobs are covered. That way, the heating elements are effectively covered and the heat will not be adjusted. 591 Even if the food is fully cooked, opening and closing an oven generally trig- gers changes in the thermostat, which in turn causes more or less electricity to be generated. This is a prohibition. One must look into the specifications of his oven before using it on Shabbos, even for cooked food. Hot Plate Without Knobs A hot plate without knobs is not usually used to cook. Rather, it is used to keep food warm. Furthermore, if there are no knobs, it is impossible to adjust the heat. Thus, some Poskim___ allow one to leave uncooked food on such a hot plate. Other Poskim recommend that even these hot plates be covered with thick foil. • One may leave a tray of uncooked peppers on a hot plate that does not have knobs (before Shabbos). Some hold that one must cover the hot plate with thick foil before doing so. Hostess Some people use a warming device called a “hostess.” It seems that it can reach___°F/90°C — hot enough to cook, given time. Thus, if one wishes to leave uncooked food on it from before Shabbos, it is recommended to cover the top of the hostess with thick foil, as it is the same as a hot plate with knobs. However, in rare cases, the inside section may be a problem of hatmanah (a Rabbinic prohibition of insulating food, that we will soon learn about), if the food is completely insulated inside a very small compartment. One should consult a Rav . Note that these machines seem to come with a light that turns on each time they are opened. This constitutes a prohibition. Bear in mind that this prohibition only applies if the food is not fully cooked (or, if necessary, less than one-third) cooked before Shabbos. It is best to ensure that all food is fully cooked before Shabbos. 593",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"591. Orchos Shabbos  2:15.

124,25/11/2025,"BISHUL: LEAVING UNCOOKED FOOD  ON A HEAT SOURCE, CONTINUED","We have seen that one may not leave uncooked food on an uncovered heat source before Shabbos. Thus far, we have discussed two ways to avoid this: making sure that the food is fully cooked and getting worse (or at a minimum, one-third cooked), or covering the heat source. We will now discuss a third method. Adding a Large Piece of Meat to the Pot One is permitted to leave a pot on the heat source by adding a large piece of meat into the pot just before Shabbos. The reasoning is as follows: The meat will not be ready to serve for the night meal, even if it was on the highest heat. Moreover, without any adjusting of the heat source, the meat will be ready to eat for the day meal. 594 When using this method, one must ensure that the raw meat will not reach___°F/43°C ( yad soledes ) by the time one brings in Shabbos. 595 Therefore, the meat must only be added shortly before the time that one brings in Shabbos. (Of course, this can only be done before Shabbos begins.) • If one invited several needy guests for the Shabbos day meal shortly before Shabbos, he can add as much food as he wants to the cholent pot, provided it includes a slow-cooking food such as meat, that will not be ready for the night meal even if it was on the highest flame, and leave it on an uncovered flame. As we have mentioned, this leniency does not apply if the raw meat will be cooked by the time the night meal arrives. It follows that those who have signifi- cantly late or long meals, so that the main course is served long enough afterwards that the meat would be ready, cannot use this method. 596 It also follows that the piece of meat must be large enough to remain uncooked throughout the night meal. • One may not put up a pot of raw eggs and add a miniscule piece of meat just before Shabbos, as the meat will surely be cooked by the time of the night meal. Note that adding in a vegetable will not work.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"594. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  253:1.

Still, the Mishnah Berurah says that one may not plan to do this ( lechatchilah ), and moreover, he forbids the food if this “mistake” happens regularly. 602 If One Has No Other Food Chazal waived this penalty for those who lack any other food whatsoever for Shabbos. 603 This is because one should ideally not fast on Shabbos. Always Consult a Rav Whenever something goes wrong, one must consult a competent Rav . There may always be more factors than what he has considered.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"597.

126,27/11/2025,BISHUL: CHAZARAH - FOOD,"Food on a Heat Source for the First Time Obviously, one may not place uncooked food directly on a heat source on Shabbos. One who does so transgresses a Torah prohibition. Chazal also prohib- ited placing cooked food directly on a heat source, as it appears to an onlooker like one is cooking. 604 Even if the fully cooked food will deteriorate by being placed on the heat source, it is prohibited. 605 Replacing a Cooked Food on a Heat Source Although it is always forbidden to place even cooked food directly on a heat source for the first time , there are circumstances under which one is permitted to replace the food, i.e., remove a pot that was on a heat source, and return it to the heat source. In order to do so, all of the following conditions must be met. 1. The food must be fully cooked (one may never put food that is not fully cooked near a heat source). As explained previously, there is no problem to warm a dry, fully cooked solid, as it does not undergo any change, but warming a cold liquid is always forbidden. 606 However, once it is fully cooked (solid) or still hot (liquid), one is permitted to place it on a covered heat source, even if putting it back on will cause it to improve. 607_. The heat source must be covered or somehow reduced. 608 The stovetop must be covered with a blech . A hot plate must be covered if it has knobs (though some say it must be covered even if it does not have knobs). A Crock-Pot must be lined with foil and the foil must be visible on the outside of the pot. 3. When removing a pot from the heat source, one must intend to return it. 609_. One may not let go of the pot, even if just to place it on a counter. If one needs to lean one side of it on a dry countertop, he may do so, making sure not to let go of the other side. 610 • If one has a pot of chicken on a blech , and he wishes to remove a piece from it and return it, he must ensure that a number of factors are present: 1. The chicken is fully cooked and any excess gravy is at least warm. 2. The heat source is covered (in this case, it is already, as it is covered with the blech ). 3. He intends to replace the pot. 4. He does not let go of the pot, although he can rest one end of the pot on a dry counter while holding the other side in midair. Note that if one fulfilled all of the conditions except either number three or number four (one either forgot to have in mind that he would return the pot, or he mistakenly let go of the pot, but not both), in a case of need, it is permitted to return the pot. 611 Keep in mind that the above set of conditions only permit returning the food once it is fully cooked. If the food is not fully cooked, putting it near or on the heat, even if it is covered, is a Torah prohibition.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"604. Mishnah Berurah  253:37. Note that the Chazon Ish held that the reason was a concern that  one would raise the heat.

One may also remove the pot from a flame, insert a blech over the heat source unless it will get red-hot, and then replace the pot on the blech (with the same four conditions). Help from a Non-Jew If one mistakenly took the pot of fully cooked food off the heat source with- out fulfilling the other conditions, he may not return the pot, but he may ask a non-Jew to put it back on the heat if it is a great necessity. 614 Once again, it is only permitted if the food is fully cooked , and was removed by mistake.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"612.

This would appear like cooking to an onlooker, and is forbidden. 616 Not Completely Cooked We have learned that before Shabbos, one may leave food that is one-third cooked on the heat source to remain cooking on Shabbos (known as shehiyah ). However, when it comes to replacing the food on a heat source on Shabbos, one may not do so until the food is completely cooked. One may also not move a pot of food that is not completely cooked to a hotter part of a hot plate. From on Top of a Pot Directly onto a Heat Source We have learned that it is permitted to place a pot of fully cooked, dry food on top of another pot that is already on the fire, even if the new pot was not on the fire until now. However, if one did so, he may not, at a later point, move the top pot directly onto the heat source. 617",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"615. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  253:2.

129,30/11/2025,BISHUL: TRANSGRESSING THE  HALACHOS OF CHAZARAH - FOOD,"Food If it was returned knowingly and intentionally, the food is forbidden to be eaten on Shabbos by anyone. It is only permitted after Shabbos once the amount of time that it took to improve on Shabbos has passed. In contrast, if it was returned unintentionally or unknowingly, the person who did the act is forbidden to eat it on Shabbos, and he may only eat it after Shabbos once he has waited the amount of time that it took the food to improve on Shabbos. However, others are permitted to eat it on Shabbos, if it was fully cooked when the person returned it to the fire in a forbidden fashion. • If one took a pot of fully cooked cholent out of an uncovered Crock- Pot cylinder, and returned the pot to the cylinder for an hour, by mis- take, he may not eat the cholent until an hour after Shabbos, because cholent generally improves as long as it is being heated. Others are permitted to eat it immediately. 621 If Reheating Did Not Improve the Food If the reheating would cause the food to get worse, or to merely keep it hot, the food is permitted. • If one removed a roast chicken from the stovetop, and then mistakenly returned it, it is still permitted. This is because a roast chicken will dry out as long as it remains on the heat. • If one mistakenly returned a hot pot of potatoes to the stovetop and kept it there for a short period, it is still permitted. This is because it was already hot at the time of the reheating, and so the extra warmth is not a considered a significant benefit. If a Non-Jew Put the Food Back On The food is permitted if the food was fully cooked. 622",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"618.

130,01/12/2025,BISHUL: HATMANAH,"The final major Rabbinic prohibition in bishul is hatmanah — wrapping food in order to keep it warm. There are two types of wrapping that are prohibited. It should be emphasized that one of these types of hatmanah is prohibited even before Shabbos if the food will remain wrapped when Shab- bos arrives. Wrapping That Adds to the Heat Chazal were concerned that one who would use a live heat source to keep something warm would ultimately come to create or add to the heat — a Torah prohibition. 623 They therefore prohibited wrapping food using heat that would add to the temperature of the food even from before Shabbos , if the food will remain wrapped when Shabbos arrives. • It is Rabbinically forbidden to use towels to cover food on a hot plate on all sides on erev Shabbos , and leave it that way through the arrival of Shabbos. 624 This is because the food would be wrapped on a heat source that increases the heat in the food. (This act is also prohibited on Shabbos.) Wrapping That Does Not Add to the Heat Chazal were concerned that one who would wrap a food that is cooling down on Shabbos would ultimately start a fire or add to an existing fire in or- der to reheat it properly — which would constitute a Torah prohibition. They therefore prohibited wrapping food on Shabbos, even if it will just maintain the current temperature. • One may not take a pot of noodles from the blech and wrap it in towels to keep it warm. This is only forbidden on Shabbos, but is permitted before Shabbos. • If an urn’s plug got dislodged on Shabbos, and one wishes to keep the water hot, he may not cover the entire urn with blankets.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"623.

131,02/12/2025,BISHUL: HATMANAH - FOOD,"Food Must Be Hot___ Wrapping is only prohibited with regards to food that is still yad soledes (109°F/43°C). Once it has cooled down past this temperature, one may wrap it, even in a kli rishon , if necessary. Note again that this leniency only applies when wrapping something off the heat source. • If one removed a pot of hot cholent___ from a hot plate and waited for it to cool down to below___°F/43°C, he is permitted to wrap it to ensure it remains warm, if necessary. He may not return it to the hot plate.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,
132,03/12/2025,BISHUL: IF ONE TRANSGRESSED  THE PROHIBITION OF HATMANAH - FOOD,"Food in a Way That Increases the Heat On Erev Shabbos If one wrapped the food before Shabbos, the food will be permitted to be eaten on Shabbos so long as it was one-third cooked before Shabbos. 636 • If one left cooked chicken on the hot plate covered in towels before Shabbos, he has transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition. Nevertheless, the food may be eaten. On Shabbos If one wrapped cold, fully cooked food on Shabbos in a situation where the heat will increase, wrapping it produces a major benefit — the food becomes warm. Because this was accomplished through a Rabbinic violation, the food is prohibited. 637 However, once the food has cooled down to its previous state, and the benefit is thus removed, the food is permitted, unless the hatmanah actually cooked it significantly further. 638 • If a person took a fully cooked, cold chicken from the refrigerator and put it on an overturned pot that is on a hot plate, and covered it totally with towels, he has transgressed the Rabbinic prohibition of hatmanah . The food will be forbidden for as long as the benefit from the act re- mains (the chicken is hot). However, once the chicken has cooled down, the food will be permitted, as long as the hatmanah did not cook it significantly more. A Wrapping That Will Not Increase the Heat If, on Shabbos, one wrapped fully cooked food in a way that the heat will merely be maintained, the food is still permitted. 639 • If one took a pot of rice off the blech on Shabbos and covered the pot totally with clothes in order to keep it warm, he has transgressed a Rab- binic prohibition.

501. This is like bread, which is considered  kalei habishul  (something that is easily cooked) for  which a  kli sheini  is prohibited. See  Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  318:6.
502. Mishnah Berurah  318:42;  Rama ,  Orach Chaim  318:5.
503. Although the  Mishnah Berurah  318:87 says that the ladle may possibly be considered a  kli  rishon  (and not a  kli sheini  like we have written). However, in this case, since there are two Halachic  doubts, there is room to be lenient.

507. It is common to put chicken in an aluminum pan with water and spices, and let it cook. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv held that this is considered roasting or baking (i.e., dry heat), as that is what  causes the cooking. However, the  Mishnah Berurah  (318:41), the Chazon Ish, and Rav Moshe  Feinstein hold that it is considered cooking, because the liquid imparts a flavor of something  cooked, and not roasted or baked, and without it, the chicken would dry out. It would seem that  according to this opinion, the cooking method is through liquid, and therefore and one may not  dry-bake it on a hot plate if it will dry out.
508. Mishnah Berurah  318:92.
509. We will discuss the only leniency: when one wishes to take the pot off and return it shortly  afterwards ( chazarah ).

513. The gravy is essentially a completely cold liquid, and reheating a cold liquid is prohibited.  Minor amounts of gravy are not consequential, and thus are permitted as part of the food itself.
514. Rama ,  Orach Chaim  318:5. Water is not easily cooked, in contrast to bread, which we learned  is easily cooked.
515. Shabbos  38b, 145b.
516. Mishnah Berurah  318:42;  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:59.
517. The Chazon Ish ( Orach Chaim  52:18, 19) held that the list of foods that are easily cooked is  comprehensive, and excludes most other foods. Thus, according to him, it is always permitted to  use a  kli sheini  unless the food would clearly cook in it. We usually rule according to the  Mishnah  Berurah , and in this case, so does Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach.
518. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:59.
519. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:63. Note that  Mishnah Berurah  318:39, in discussing mak- ing tea, does not suggest using a  kli shelishi . This implies that with obvious  kalei habishul , we still  consider it able to cook. Similarly, in 318:47, the author only brought the Pri  Megadim  that is  lenient regarding bread.
520. Although reheating using a different form of heat is prohibited, it is actually the subject  of a dispute. We rule strictly, but where there is another factor, we may be lenient. Thus, in a  kli  shelishi  where there is a doubt if it can cook at all, coupled with a previously cooked item, we are  lenient. Challah is baked, so we are lenient regarding putting it in a  kli shelishi . If the coffee powder  is baked, we are lenient regarding placing it in a  kli shelishi .
521. Note that one may not serve from a pot that is still on the heat source. If one did so, the soup  in the ladle is definitely still considered a  kli rishon .
522. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:68.
523. Ibid. 1:63. Note that Rav   Moshe Feinstein in  Igros Moshe ,  Orach Chaim  4:74:15 holds that  a  kli shelishi  never cooks, and if so, a tea bag would be permitted.
524. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  318:10.
525. Mishnah Berurah  318:74.
526. However, pouring onto insignificant drops of previously cooked liquid is not a problem.
527. Note that the Chazon Ish was concerned that something dispensed from something still  attached to the heat source will remain a  kli rishon  even in the second vessel ( Taamei D’Kra ,  Hora’os  M’Chazon Ish  11). Most other  Poskim  are lenient.
528. Note that the food will not be prohibited if it was already cooked, albeit through a different  form of heat ( Biur Halachah  318:10, “ Assur .” Also, it will still be permitted if the stream of water  was not an unconnected stream when it hit the food ( Mishnah Berurah  318:74), even if the food  had never been previously cooked.
529. Mishnah Berurah  318:39. Note that if, after the hot water is poured into the cold water, the  combination is less than  yad soledes , this is permitted.

538. Even though butter looks like a solid now, it was cooked as a liquid.
539. Even though  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  1:64 is lenient because tomato sauce could be  considered a dry food, the one that is generally purchased today flows like a liquid, and thus one  should be stringent.

545. Mishnah Berurah  318:113 brings it as a dispute, but seems to conclude strictly. Certainly, if  one needs just to cut a piece of a pie or take roast potatoes — i.e., foods that are separate and not  part of a mixture — it is permitted.

133,04/12/2025,APPLICATIONS OF BISHUL:  THE CROCK-POT,"We have discussed the halachos pertaining to heating foods on Shabbos. We discussed cooking and reheating, and distinguished between solids and liquids. We have also discussed the three Rabbinic prohibitions: shehiyah (leaving un- cooked food on an uncovered heat source before Shabbos), chazarah (returning a pot to a heat source on Shabbos), and hatmanah (wrapping food to either maintain or increase warmth). One situation in which there are major applications of these halachos is the Crock-Pot that is commonly used today. It consists of a ceramic pot resting in a cylinder surrounded by hot coils at the bottom (and usually the sides as well). This cylinder is no different from a stove — despite the heating elements being covered, it is considered the same as an uncovered stovetop because it is usually used to cook. Furthermore, there are dials, and thus, an added concern that one may turn up the heat. Problem One The pot presents an issue of shehiyah — leaving an uncooked cholent in the cylinder (which is Halachically considered an uncovered flame) before Shabbos, if it will remain in the cylinder once Shabbos begins. Solution There are several ways to avoid shehiyah : making sure that the food is at least half cooked before Shabbos; 640 or adding a large piece of raw meat to the pot just before Shabbos; or , most ideally, covering the heat source (in this case, lining the cylinder with foil) and putting tape on the dials. Problem Two If one wishes to take the pot out of the cylinder in order to take some cho- lent___ and put it back in order to keep it hot for later, it presents a problem of chazarah — returning food to an uncovered heat source. Solution We learned that one is permitted to do chazarah so long as the four condi- tions are in place. Therefore, one must ensure that: 1. The cholent is fully cooked when he takes it off. 2. The heat source has been covered by lining the inside of the cylinder with foil, so that the foil is visible on the outside of the cylinder, and taping the dials. 3. He has the intention to return the cholent pot to the heat source at the time that it is being removed. 4. He keeps hold of the pot as long as it is away from the heat source. Problem Three The pot is snugly placed inside the cylinder, a heat source that increases heat — which is the prohibition of hatmanah . Solution Some Poskim recommend placing a few small aluminum foil balls between the bottom of the pot and the cylinder, in order to create a gap between them. 642 Thus, the contact between the cylinder and the pot is considered insignificant. If one cannot do this, he may rely on the fact that the lid is not being covered, and thus, the pot is not considered fully wrapped. 643 Problem Four If the cholent is drying out and one needs to add hot water, how does he go about it? As we discussed earlier, one may not add anything to the cholent pot while it is on the fire, because it looks like cooking. Furthermore, adding food or liquid to a pot causes a problem of “stirring” on the fire, as it will cause a movement of the pot’s contents. Solution One should pick up the cholent pot, using the four conditions of chazarah (as reviewed in “Problem Two”). Then, he should open the tap on the urn and allow the water to flow into the pot. After this, he may return it to the cylinder. The pot should be held very far from the urn, because the steam that connects them may cause the urn to become fleishig. As this is not so practical and still may cause kashrus problems, it is preferable to fill a cup with hot water from the urn, and empty it slowly into the cholent pot that one is holding. (It is advisable to get a second person to help with this.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"640. As we learned earlier, ideally one should not leave even fully cooked food on an uncovered  fire. However, if necessary, one may leave on the fire food that is half cooked, and in a time of  need, one-third cooked, before Shabbos begins.
641. As we learned earlier, one should not remove food from a pot of food while it is on the fire,  even if the food is fully cooked.

Note that Rav   Shlomo Zalman Auerbach and Rav   Yosef Shalom Elyashiv held that it is  forbidden to be lenient even if the lid is not covered, because this is the way that Crock-Pots cook."
134,05/12/2025,BISHUL: FURTHER PRACTICAL  APPLICATIONS OF THE HALACHOS  OF WARMING FOOD,"Below are some more practical halachos relating to warming food or liquids on Shabbos. Baby Bottle One may pour hot water from the urn over the outside of a dry baby bottle to remove the chill. 644 Furthermore, one may fill a bowl with hot water directly from the urn ( kli sheini ), and place the bottle in it to warm up, being careful to ensure that the bottle is not fully immersed in the water, which would be a problem of hatmanah (insulating). It is forbidden to put a baby bottle near a heater or blech to warm up. Chazal were concerned that it would be left there until it reaches yad soledes , which involves a Torah prohibition. Warming Up Cold Tea or Coffee If the tea or coffee is cold, one may not pour hot water into it directly from the urn, as a liquid that has cooled down is considered uncooked. Rather, he can pour the water from the urn into an empty cup, which assumes the status of a kli sheini , and from there, pour it into the cup with the tea or coffee. If the tea or coffee is lukewarm, and one would still drink it as such, he is permitted to pour hot water into it directly from the urn. However, he must be sure not to add anything new (such as a slice of lemon) that wasn’t already cooked. He must also avoid steam connecting the urn and tea or coffee, which may cause milk-meat issues. Pot Covers Often, vapor rises from a pot and collects on the inside rim of the cover. If this vapor cools down, it is forbidden to pour it back into the hot pot. (Be warned that the vapor cools down very quickly.) Hot-Water Bottle One can pour hot water into an empty hot-water bottle. Although using a hot-water bottle is a form of healing (which is generally prohibited), it is per- mitted because it is also used to warm people up. 645",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"644.

135,06/12/2025,BORER (SELECTING),"Introduction The next melachah we will learn about is borer — selecting something from a mixture. Part of the process of making bread in the Mishkan was to remove stones and grains that were bad from the mixture, leaving a pile of clean grain. 646 Thus, it is a forbidden act on Shabbos (not just with food, but with all objects, as we will explain). We will see that borer is a Torah prohibition that we encounter very often on Shabbos, because of the many mixtures that we will discuss. Here are several examples of situations that may incur the borer prohibition: • Removing tomatoes or onions from a salad • Removing bones from fish or chicken • Taking an insect out of a bowl of soup • Choosing clothes to wear from a messy closet • Selecting silverware when setting a table • Sorting children’s toys after playtime • Taking a siddur or Chumash out of a pile of sefarim Before we go into the details of the melachah , here are the basic rules to follow. 647 There are three conditions which, if met, will circumvent the borer prohibition. If all three are not met, one transgresses the Torah prohibition, so one must be certain to apply all three of them . These rules will be explained in greater detail later on. 1. One must select only the good item (what he wants), not the bad item (what he is trying to remove or avoid). 2. One must only select using his hand, not with a tool that is used for se- lecting, such as a sifter or funnel (although a fork, if used as an extension of one’s hand, and not as a sifting tool, is considered like his hand___ ). 3. One must only select something that is needed for immediate use, not something that is only needed for later. • If one has a bowl of fruit, selecting a particular fruit from the bowl pres- ents a borer issue. If one wishes to do so, he must take the fruit that he wants (the good) using his hand (it is forbidden to use a slotted spoon), and take the fruit immediately before he wishes to eat it. • If lemon seeds fell into a salad bowl, it is forbidden to take them out, as that would be selecting the bad, which constitutes a Torah prohibi- tion of borer . Rather, one must transfer the rest of the salad (the good) elsewhere, using his hand (and not a utensil that is made for filtering), immediately before it is to be eaten (not to store until a later stage). A helpful way to remember these three conditions is using the acronym GHI : g ood, h and, i mmediate.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"646. Shabbos  73a.
647. Mishnah Berurah  319, introduction."
136,07/12/2025,BORER: DEFINING “GOOD” AND “BAD”,"We have seen that it is a Torah prohibition to select from a mixture. The only way that doing so is permitted is by fulfilling all three conditions ( GHI ) — Taking the g ood from the bad, using only one’s h and, and only doing so for i mmediate use. Two “Good” Things We gave examples of things that are objectively good and bad, such as a salad (good) with lemon seeds (bad). But how does one go about fulfilling the condition of taking good from bad when both things are good, just that one only desires one of them at the moment? Selecting from two good things is also a transgression of borer . The rule is that whatever one desires at this point is considered good, and ev- erything else is considered bad, relative to what he wants. 649 Therefore, one may only remove what he wants from the mixture, using his hand, and only for immediate use. • If one has a plate of mixed carrots and peas, and he generally eats both, but right now he only wants the carrots — although both are good, the carrots assume the status of good because the carrots are what he wants right now, and the peas assume the status of bad. He may only take the carrots, using his hand or a fork, at the time that he is ready to eat them. 650 • One’s daughter loves both peas and carrots, but for some reason, she refuses to eat them at the same time. So long as she wants the mixture to be separated before eating, he may only remove the vegetable she wants to eat first (with his hand or a fork, and when she is ready to eat it), even though she will start to eat the second type of vegetable as soon as she finishes the first type.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"648.

137,08/12/2025,BORER: DEFINING “MIXTURE”,"We have seen that borer is the separating of something “bad” from some- thing ”good,” and that one may avoid the prohibition by fulfilling the three requirements: selecting the g ood, by h and, for i mmediate use ( GHI ). We also saw that even if two things are both “good,” one must still select only what he wants for now. A Mixture Borer is only prohibited when there is a mixture of two or more different types of items. If the items are the same, it is permitted to separate them. “Different” Items Borer is only incurred when the mixture has two or more different items. What is considered different? • Different names : salmon and tuna; chicken and meat • Different tastes : roasted meat and boiled meat; 651 strawberry yogurt and peach yogurt • Different usage : big forks and small forks; soup bowls and dessert bowls; Shabbos suit and weekday suit • Different quality : fresh milk and milk that is turning sour; sturdy chairs and wobbly chairs It is clear from the above list that the intrinsic uniqueness of something — whether in name, taste, usage, or quality —sets it apart from another item, causing a combination of the two to be considered a mixture, and requiring the application of the three rules ( GHI ). • Juicy pieces of chicken mixed with dried-out or burnt pieces are forbid- den to be separated without the three conditions, even if they are all the same type and flavor of chicken. 652 • Mackerel mixed with herring may not be separated without the three conditions, even though they are both fish. • Magna-Tiles mixed with blocks may not be separated without the three conditions, even though they are both toys. “The Same” Types of Items On the other hand, if two items do not have any essential difference in name, taste, usage or quality, there is no borer prohibition when separating them. Some examples include: • Big oranges and small oranges • Blocks of different shapes (when they are used in the same game) Although there is a difference, it is not something intrinsic enough to make one type good, and the other, bad. Thus, the three conditions are not required when separating them. • Big and small pieces of the same type of fried fish have no essential difference. Therefore, it is not considered selecting to separate them. 653 • Skin and flesh of chicken are both considered chicken. Some Poskim are stringent in cases where most people regard the skin and flesh equally, but the one currently selecting dislikes one of them. 654 We will learn that even according to the stringent opinion, one may remove skin that is in the way as long as it is just before eating.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"651.

Small Solids in Liquids When a small solid is mixed into a liquid, it is forbidden to separate them. • Noodles___ or a fly in soup. 659 • Egg yolks in egg whites. 660 All of the above cases carry the prohibition of borer , and one would need to fulfill all three conditions in order to separate them. What Is Not Considered Mixed In the reverse situations, borer is permitted even without any of the three conditions. Easy to Separate If the items are easy to separate, they are unlikely to be considered a mixture. • Drinks that are spread out on a table. 661 Not Attached If two things are not attached, they are less likely to be a mixture. • A cup and a saucer. Big Solids in a Liquid If solids are so big that they are easily discernable inside a liquid, it is not considered a mixture. 662 • A large piece of ice that is in one’s cup of soda. Neat and Clearly Distinguishable If the items are both neat and clearly distinguishable (i.e., big or clearly labeled), they are not considered a mixture. 663 • One can remove a sefer or book that is clearly labeled and distinguishable from a bookshelf. Small Quantities If there are two or three pieces of cutlery on a plate, they are not considered a mixture. 664 However, once there are more than that, they become a mixture, and one needs to fulfill the three conditions in order to separate them. • A tray with two knives and one fork is not a mixture. One may take whatever he wants. • A tray with more than two knives and two forks (or with other silver- ware) starts to appear like a mixture.

However, if one wishes to remove coats in order to get to other coats, it is permitted. 666 Fruit Slices on a Platter On a fruit platter where orange slices are neatly stacked on apple slices, if one wishes to remove the orange slices so that only apple slices remain, it is forbidden. However, it is permitted to remove the orange slices in order to get to the apple slices, even if one does not put them back. Towels in a Closet In an organized closet, if one removes the hand towels so that the closet will only have large towels, it is forbidden. However, it is permitted to remove the hand towels in order to get to the large towels. Looking at Pictures If one removes a picture from a pile of photos in order to organize the pile, it is forbidden. However, it is permitted to remove the top picture in order to see the next one.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"665.

140,11/12/2025,BORER: MORE PERMITTED MIXTURES,"We have seen that two things that are intrinsically the same are not consid- ered a mixture, and one may remove whatever he wishes. 667 Let us explore some applications of this, and the three exceptions that apply. Big Mixed with Small If big and small kinds of the same item are mixed, and there is no qualitative difference because of the size, it is permitted to sort them. • One may select from a mixture of big and small oranges as he wishes. Fresh with Less Fresh If there is a mixture of the same type of food, with some being a little fresher than others, it is permitted to sort because it is not a significant difference. (See exceptions below.) • If one has a plate of salami, but some are fresh from the packet and others are from yesterday, there is no issue of borer . However, if the old ones have started to dry out or otherwise become undesirable, it is a borer problem. See below. Wings, Legs, and Thighs Different parts of a chicken are not considered different things, and one may separate as he wishes. 668 However, chicken liver and chicken legs are considered different, and thus, they constitute a borer problem. • One can remove the white meat of a chicken for a later meal if he wishes, and be left with the dark meat of the same type of food for this meal.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"667. Rama ,  Orach Chaim  319:3.
668. Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in  Orchos Shabbos , p. 139."
141,12/12/2025,BORER: EXCEPTIONS,"There are exceptions to the rule that seemingly similar items are not a mix- ture that is subject to the prohibition. When the Okay Becomes Too Undesirable Bear in mind that even the same type of item can be considered bad if it would not be eaten or used unless absolutely necessary. If such items are mixed with useable ones, this would be considered a mixture of good and bad, and it is prohibited to separate them. 669 • A lettuce leaf that has good and okay parts is not a mixture, and one may remove whatever he wishes to. However, once the okay part be- comes undesirable enough to warrant being discarded in most situ- ations, it is considered bad, and one is prohibited to separate it from the good ones. • A stack of wobbly and regular chairs of the same type can be sorted without being an issue of borer . However, once there are some chairs that are bad enough to warrant not using them unless absolutely nec- essary, it is prohibited to sort them, because the broken chairs are considered bad. Halachically Preferable Mixed with Halachically Less Preferable Items If the difference is not physical, but rather, Halachic, it is considered an intrinsic difference, and such a mixture may not be sorted. 670 • Ideally, one should try to use two whole challos by his Shabbos meals — a mitzvah known as lechem mishneh (see Day__). Although broken challos can be used to fulfill the mitzvah of having three meals on Shab- bos, they cannot be used for lechem mishneh . Therefore, one may not remove the broken challos or matzos from a mixture in order that only the whole ones should be left. • Before eating produce grown in Eretz Yisrael, it needs to have undergone separation of certain tithing obligations such as terumos and maasros , without which, one may not eat them. (In stores that have Rabbinic su- pervision, this is usually done before they are sold). If one has a mixture of separated and unseparated produce, he may not take the unseparated produce out. Personal Tastes If one personally finds a food repulsive or inedible, even if others do not care about it, that item is bad as it relates to him, and he is forbidden to separate it from something that it is mixed with. 671 We will discuss this concept in depth at a later stage. • Even though onions in a salad are normal and generally eaten, one who dislikes them may not remove them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"669.

142,13/12/2025,BORER: SEPARATING WHILE EATING - FOOD,"Food in One’s Mouth If one is eating and removes what is inedible from his mouth, it is not con- sidered borer , because it is part of the eating process. 673 • One is permitted to spit out grape seeds while eating grapes, or fish bones while eating fish. Food in One’s Hands If it is normal to hold a food and remove what is inedible before eating it, there is a discussion as to whether it constitutes borer . The lenient opinion holds that it is permitted because one is not really selecting in order to sort a mixture. Rather, he is merely beginning the eating process. 674 However, the strict opinion still views this as an act of borer . Therefore, one should be stringent to eat the food and then remove the bad parts from his mouth. • One who is eating a peach has the following options, in order of Hala- chic preference: 1. He should preferably eat around the pit. 2. He can cut it in half and remove the peach from the pit. 3. If he cannot do either of these, then, just before he eats it, he should hold it and take the pit out normally.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"672.

143,14/12/2025,"BORER: PEELING FRUIT, VEGETABLES,  SEEDS, AND EGGS","Many fruits and vegetables have peels that are not ordinarily eaten, such as nuts, oranges, bananas, and onions. These peels are considered bad, and present a borer issue. Note that the peels are considered bad even if one would eat them if he had to. 675 • One may not peel carrots without applying the three conditions. Peelers and Knives Using a peeler (even for immediate consumption) is prohibited, as it con- stitutes borer . 676 However, one is permitted to use a knife to peel (applying the three con- ditions), for two reasons: First, a knife is not considered a “ borer tool” — it is more of a facilitator for eating. 677 Second, although it more or less gets the job done, using a knife is not an ideal way to peel. 678 Thus, the knife fits in to the category of “by hand,” but one must also apply the other two conditions — namely, taking the good from the bad (this is more of a state of mind in this case, as his intention is to eat, not to remove the bad), and doing so for immediate consumption. • One may not use a peeler to peel carrots. However, he can use a knife to peel carrots that will be eaten immediately. The Stem There is a dispute regarding whether the stem is “mixed” into the fruit or vegetable. Thus, it is advisable not to remove the stem separately. Rather, one should only remove the stem immediately before eating, or with some of the fruit. • It is better to cut away the stem of a tomato together with some of the actual tomato. No Other Way to Get to the Fruit A fruit or vegetable that can only be eaten by removing the peel has a leni- ency: peeling such a fruit or vegetable is really the process of eating , not selecting bad from good. One may peel such a food fulfilling just two conditions: ( HI ) using one’s h and or knife and doing so i mmediately before eating it. Even if it is possible to somehow eat the fruit without removing the peel, one need not go to such measures — whatever is normal to do, is permitted. 679 • There is no normal way to eat a banana without removing the peel (the bad). Therefore, one is permitted to remove the peel with his hand immediately before he wishes to eat it. • The normal way to eat an orange is to remove the peel first. One is per- mitted to remove the peel with his hand or knife just before he wishes to eat it. He need not cut it in half and scoop out the fruit. Seeds If the presence of seeds in a fruit is sporadic enough that one normally eats the fruit and spits out the seeds, this is what he should do. Otherwise, he may shake out the seeds before eating. 680 • One should eat grapes, watermelons, or oranges and spit out the seeds, rather than removing them beforehand. If this is not convenient, he may shake out the seeds before eating. If there is a high concentration of seeds, and there is no way to eat the fruit other than to remove them first, one may certainly do so just before eating. 681 • One may remove the seeds from papayas or melons immediately before eating. As mentioned previously, if the seed is large, it is best to hold the fruit and pull it away from the seed. If this is not possible, one may remove the seed. • It is best to pull a peach or avocado from its pit. If this is not possible, one may remove the pit. Egg Shells The shell with the egg it is attached to are considered a mixture of good and bad. However, there is no way to eat the egg without removing the shell. There- fore, one may remove the shell, but only with one’s h and and only i mmediately before eating it. 682",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"675.

144,15/12/2025,BORER: LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS,"We mentioned that if solids are so big that they are easily discernable inside a liquid, it is not considered a mixture and one is permitted to remove them. 683 Let us now discuss small solids that are not clearly distinguishable inside a liquid. Solid foods often sink into liquids. In such a case, removing the unwanted liquid in order to be left with the solid is a problem of borer . However, it is only the point where the solids and the liquids mix that is the problem. All of the liquid above that mixture is not considered a mixture at all, and therefore, is not subject to borer . Accordingly, one avoids the issue by pour- ing out the liquid up until the point where it meets the solids, 684 but not further. Soup from Kneidelach • If one wants the kneidelach at the bottom of a soup pot, he can pour out the soup until the level where the kneidlach are, but not further. Oil or Brine from Tuna or Sardines • If one does not want the extra oil or brine on top of tuna or sardines, he can gently pour out the top layer up until the point where it is mixed in with the solids. (Note that opening cans on Shabbos will be discussed in Day___). Water from Canned Vegetables • If one does not want the water from a can of peas, corn, or the like, if there is water above the level of the vegetable, he may gently pour out the water up until the level where it is mixed in with the solids. 685 Liquid from Small Pieces of Ice • If one wants the small bits of ice at the bottom of a cup that has a drink inside it, he may pour out the drink until the point where it is mixed with the ice. 686 A Sifting Vessel Note that one may never use a sifting vessel on Shabbos, even in the above cases. 687 • One must pour out the soup, brine, oil, or drink by tilting the vessel, not by using the lid to sift it, or a slotted spoon to funnel it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"683.

145,16/12/2025,BORER: GOOD TOGETHER WITH BAD,"We have seen that the only way to circumvent borer is to ensure that three conditions are fulfilled ( GHI ) — taking the g ood, with one’s h and, for i mmediate use. We have also learned that one does not transgress borer during the normal eating process, and we discussed the limitations of this rule. More recently, we saw that one may pour out unwanted liquid up until the point where it is mixed with solids, but only by pouring, and only for immediate use. There is another leniency regarding the removal of an unwanted item: one is permitted to remove the “bad” if he also removes some of the good that is mixed together with it. In this way, one is merely removing the mixture, and not taking the bad from the good. 688 This is such a fundamental difference that it can even be done for later use. We will discuss a limitation to this rule below. Here are some practical examples: • Removing a fly from soup is borer . However, one may use a spoon and scoop out the fly together with some of the soup that it is floating in. • Removing bones from fish or meat for later use is borer . (We have seen that one is permitted to do so while he is eating the fish [see Day___].) However, it is permitted to remove the bone together with some of the meat that is attached to it, even if it will only be used later. • Removing a small seed from a fruit is borer , because one can eat the fruit normally and spit out the seeds. However, one may remove the seed together with some of the fruit that it is attached to. • Removing unwanted cream floating in tea or coffee is borer . However, one is permitted to use a spoon and scoop out the cream together with some of the milk that it is floating in. • Removing the bruised part of an apple or peach is borer . However, one is permitted to cut away the bruise together with some of the good fruit that it is attached to. • Removing a mass of unwanted salt or pepper from a cholent is borer . However, one is permitted to remove the mass together with some of the cholent that it is in. Limitation of This Rule Note that this rule can only apply where there is one bad item in something good, and after it is removed together with some good, the rest is just good. However, if the rest of the mixture will still need fixing, the act has only fixed part of a problem — and one has effectively taken out bad from good and bad. 689 Minimizing a mixture is prohibited; removing so that there is no longer a mixture is permitted. • If six peanuts mistakenly fell into a bowl of soup, if one would take out one peanut together with some soup, he would effectively be fixing only part of a problem. This is forbidden. One may pour all the peanuts into another bowl together with soup, so that the original bowl is left with soup alone.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"688.

146,17/12/2025,BORER: DEFINING “BY HAND”,"Until now, we have focused on the first of the three requirements for cir- cumventing borer : selecting the good from a mixture. We will now begin to discuss the second requirement — removing by hand. 690 What is considered “a hand,” and what is considered “a sifting vessel”? (Note that a sifting vessel is always prohibited, even if the other two conditions are met.) Torah Prohibition The use of any implement whose principle use is to sift or filter is a Torah prohibition. 691 Some examples include a sifter, a corer, a sieve, and a strainer. Rabbinic Prohibition The use of any implement that facilitates or is sometimes used for filtering is a Rabbinic prohibition. Examples include a slotted spoon, which is often used to strain liquid out of solid food. • If one has a liquidy cholent, using a slotted spoon in order to take the food and leave behind the liquid is Rabbinically prohibited. 692 Permitted: A Hand Using one’s hand is not considered using a sifting vessel at all. 693 However, one must still only take the g ood for i mmediate use. Cutlery Forks and spoons are generally used to avoid getting one’s hands dirty while eating, 694 and therefore they are not classic sifting tools. 695 One may use a fork to select pieces of apple that he wants from a fruit salad, even though he is using a “tool” to do so. This is because a fork is regarded like an extension of one’s hand. A Jug with Teeth The Poskim debate whether a jug that has teeth to prevent the ice from pour- ing out is considered a sifting vessel. 696 If the ice is big and thus clearly discernible from the liquid, there is no mixture and one may use it. If the ice has dissolved and is now small, it is recommended that one avoid using such a jug, unless he does not mind if the ice can theoretically drop in.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"690.

147,18/12/2025,BORER: MORE BORER UTENSILS - FOOD,"Food Similarly, some Poskim hold that one may not press a utensil against food at the side of a pot of liquid while pouring, in order to drain the liquid from the solids. Doing so causes the utensil to be considered a borer vessel. • According to some Poskim , one may not press a fork against a clump of vegetables in a pot of soup to prevent them from coming out as the soup is being poured. Pickled Cucumber or Olive Holder One may not use a pickled-cucumber, olive, or chili strainer since when it is raised, the solids rise and the liquids drip out. 699 However, the following items are permitted if one takes the g ood and uses it i mmediately: Nutcracker One may crack open nuts using a (nonelectric) nutcracker. The purpose of a nutcracker is to break the shell, not to separate the shell from the nut. How- ever, one must be sure to remove the g ood nut from the bad shell, and eat it i mmediately. 700 Saltshaker with Rice Inside One is allowed to use a saltshaker even though the holes prevent clumps of salt from coming out, since the true purpose of the holes is to allow a reasonable amount of salt to come out. However, one should not use a saltshaker that has rice inside, since the holes act as a sieve preventing the rice from coming out. 701 Tap One is allowed to use a tap on Shabbos, even though the netting on the faucet prevents undesirables from coming out. 702 Filters According to come Poskim , one may use a nonelectric water filter on Shab- bos, even though the water gets purified within. But if normal tap water is not drunk in that place because it contains dirt or unwanted material, one may not use a water filter. 703",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"697.

148,19/12/2025,BORER: BORER THAT OCCURS  AUTOMATICALLY,"There are two more types of borer utensils that we will discuss. Spreading Out a Mixture One way to undo a mixture is to spread the items across a surface. In this way, the items are separated from each other, and the mixture is now undone, alleviating the borer problem. Some Poskim permit doing this, 704 and one can rely on this if necessary. Note that the mixture has to truly be undone. If the pile remains mixed, it is still prohibited to sort the items. • If necessary, one is permitted to toss a pile of cutlery onto a table in a way that the silverware are not touching each other, and then take one item at a time (as they are no longer mixed). • If necessary, one may empty a basket of fresh laundry onto a bed in a way that the clothes are not touching each other, and then sort them (as they are no longer mixed). Using Water to Separate Visible Dirt It is forbidden to wash fruits that are mixed with dirt by soaking them in water in order to remove the visible dirt that is mixed in or stuck to them (even if one plans to eat them immediately). 705 This is because the water is acting as a sifter. 706 However, most Poskim permit putting a fruit that has dust stuck on it under a faucet before eating it, on condition that one plans to eat the fruit immediate- ly___ thereafter. 708 • If a cluster of grapes has sand mixed inside it, one may not soak it in water. However, many Poskim permit washing it under a faucet, if he plans to eat it immediately thereafter. • If a grape falls on the floor, one may rinse it off under a faucet, if he plans to eat it immediately thereafter. Invisible Dirt: Hygienic Reasons If the dirt on the fruit is not visible, and one is merely washing it for hygienic reasons, according to all opinions he may wash the fruit, even for later use. 709 • If one wishes to wash cucumbers because he does not know who may have handled them previously, he may place them under a faucet on Shabbos, according to all opinions.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"704.

149,20/12/2025,BORER: DEFINING “IMMEDIATE USE”,"We have covered the first two of the three necessary conditions of borer — taking the g ood, and using one’s h and. We will now define the final requirement: i mmediate use. Close to the Meal When it comes to separating a mixture using the three conditions, selecting the good to eat or use with one’s hand is only permitted close to the meal. 710 This is defined as however long before the meal this action is needed during preparations for that meal. 711 Here are some examples: Setting the Table As part of the normal preparation for an upcoming meal, one can sort a mixed pile of cutlery to set the table. Note that a cutlery box that is already organized into individual sections is not a problem of borer , since the individual types of cutlery are not mixed together. Peeling Vegetables One may only peel vegetables (with a knife, not a peeler) during the normal preparation time of an upcoming meal, but not earlier. Choosing Clothes One may only choose clothes from a messy closet immediately before the time that he will wear them or dress his children with them. One may not re- move the desired clothes for children on Friday night in order to use them on Shabbos morning. 712 A Meal That Requires More Preparation Time If one is expecting a large crowd, more preparation time is needed before a meal. In such a case, he is permitted to prepare earlier than if he had a small crowd. The window of time in which borer is permitted before a meal or use is relative to its size. 713 • A caterer preparing a meal for three hundred people is permitted to peel fruits or vegetables or engage in other forms of permitted selecting (with the other two conditions) as long as the other preparations for the meal have begun, and the preparation is estimated to end with the commence- ment of the meal. However, the caterer may not deliberately plan for even a small break before the meal once preparations are complete. If he does require such a break, the acts of borer that are needed for the meal must be saved for after that break, immediately before the meal commences.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"710.

150,21/12/2025,"BORER: DEFINING “IMMEDIATE USE,” CONTINUED","We have been discussing the third condition, that one may only perform borer (by taking the g ood by h and), i mmediately preceding the meal or use, within the time period that is normally used to prepare such a thing. We will now elaborate on this concept with a few more rules. For Now and for Later One may only select what is necessary for the upcoming meal or use. It is forbidden to sort a great deal more than what is currently needed, for later use. 714 • One may only peel vegetables (with a knife) that are necessary for the upcoming meal. It is forbidden to peel extra vegetables for a later meal. However, if one is peeling extra vegetables because there is a small chance that they will be needed for the current meal or because he wants to make the guests feel that there is more than enough for all, it is permitted with the three conditions. If One Is Not Able to Do the Selecting Later One is not permitted to perform borer earlier in the day just because he will not be able to do it later. This would still be considered borer for a later use, which is forbidden. 715 This differs from someone who is busy preparing for a meal for a long period of time, who is permitted to perform borer with the other two conditions anytime during his preparations, provided he is working up until the meal. • One may not peel vegetables (even with a knife) before going to shul just because the meal will be starting immediately after he comes home, and he will not have time to do it then. This would be considered per- forming borer for later use. (If this is the situation, one should prepare on erev Shabbos or before the meal starts.) • One may not select medicine before going to sleep from an untidy medicine cabinet where the various medicines are mixed together, if he knows that it will only be needed later on that night. 716 Before the Meal, for the Dessert Course When one is preparing immediately before the meal, he may do whatever is necessary for the upcoming meal, regardless of whether it is being used in the beginning or the end of the meal. 717 • One is permitted to peel fruit (with a knife) before the meal, even though it will only be served at dessert, even if that will be a few hours into the meal. If Delayed If one did select at the correct time (just before use) and then something came up that delayed their use, there is no issue. • If one sorted the cutlery and set the table immediately before the pro- jected start of the meal, and a guest arrived late, it is not an issue. • If one peeled fruits within the normal preparation time before a meal, and not all of them were eaten, it is not an issue.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"714.

151,22/12/2025,BORER: FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS.,"SOMEONE ELSE'S BENEFIT One is permitted to select or sort (using the three conditions: taking the g ood, with one’s h and, for i mmediate use) for someone else’s benefit. 718 In such a case, the requirement of “immediate use” applies to the beneficiary of the borer . • It is permitted to peel cucumbers (with a knife) for a friend if the friend plans to eat the cucumber immediately after the peeling. This is consid- ered part of the friend’s act of eating. • It is permitted to take out the necessary forks from a bag of mixed plastic cutlery to be used at the kiddush that will commence immediately, even though the benefit is for all the other people there. My Bad That Is His Good If I really do not want something, but my friend does want it, I am permitted to remove what is bad for me and good for him and give it to him immediately. This is because I am taking it for him, and it is considered good in this situation. He must also eat or use it immediately. 719 • If I do not want the bananas in my fruit salad, but my friend does want them, I am permitted to remove the bananas (by hand) from a mixed fruit salad and give them to him if he will eat them presently. • If part of the cholent burns, and I want to get rid of the burnt part so that I can serve the rest, I can take out the burnt cholent and give it to someone who actually likes burnt cholent, and then serve the rest.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"718.

152,23/12/2025,BORER: IF IT HAPPENED,"We have seen (in Day__) that one who transgresses a Torah prohibition (such as cooking) on Shabbos: • Intentionally and knowingly: the food is forbidden to him forever, but permitted to others after Shabbos. 720 • Unintentionally or unknowingly: the food is forbidden to all until after Shabbos. In cases of need, it may be permitted. 721 Fixing a mixture by removing an item is a different type of melachah . There is no physical change in the item. Cooking can cause an inedible item to be- come edible, but merely removing an item from a mixture does not effect a real change in the item or its usage. Therefore, borer possesses a leniency. If one has transgressed it unintentionally or unknowingly, the food is permitted to all, even on Shabbos. 722 Mistakes are the more likely scenario, and so, it may be worth remembering this leniency, upon which one may rely post facto . However, intentional and knowing transgressions remain as stated above. • If one peeled cucumbers with a knife but for later use (not for imme- diate use) or he used a sieve (a vessel) to separate baby tomatoes from big ones: • Intentionally and knowingly: they are forbidden to him forever, and permitted to others only after Shabbos has ended. • Unintentionally or unknowingly: they are permitted to all, even on Shabbos. • If one removed lemon seeds from a salad (he did not take the good): • Intentionally and knowingly: the salad is forbidden to him forever, and permitted to others only after Shabbos has ended. • Unintentionally or unknowingly: the salad is not prohibited to anyone. Non-Jews If a non-Jew did borer for a Jew, the food is permitted. One is allowed to ask a non-Jew to sort a mixture, even though the non-Jew will do it in the most efficient way, which is by removing the bad from the good. 723 Borer That Is the Subject of Dispute If the act of borer in question is the subject of a dispute amongst the Poskim , the item is permitted even on Shabbos. 724 Indeed, since there are many subtle- ties and opinions regarding the prohibition of borer , such situations require the advice of a Rav .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"720.

153,24/12/2025,TOCHEN (GRINDING),"The next melachah that we will discuss is tochen — grinding or chopping finely. As we have seen, all the Torah prohibitions of Shabbos are based on the work that took place in the building of the Mishkan. 725 After separating the grain from the shells and stones ( borer ), they would proceed to grind the grain. They also ground herbs. Accordingly, tochen constitutes a Torah prohibition. 726 DEFINING THE MELACHAH The acts that are included in the melachah of tochen are grinding, crushing, and cutting into small pieces. 727 It is permitted to cut into large pieces. However, precisely what is considered large or small is a matter of dispute. Therefore, be- cause this is a Torah prohibition, one should be careful only to cut into chunks, 728 and not into very small pieces or diced. • One can cut a big tomato (not cherry) into eight slices, but not more than that. 729 Grinding or Mashing Included in the prohibition of tochen is mashing. One is not allowed to mash fruits or vegetables. • One is not allowed to mash a potato or apples. There is a dispute regarding mashing things that will remain as a lump, such as bananas and avocados. In cases of need, one should do so in an abnormal way (with a shinui ) and only close to the time he wants to eat it. • According to many Poskim , mashing a banana is prohibited under to- chen . If one really needs to do so, such as if a baby needs to eat it, he is permitted to mash it with the handle of a fork. This may only be done immediately before it is eaten. 730",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"725. We will not be discussing each  melachah  in the order that it took place. Rather,we will be  addressing them in the order that is most practical.

154,25/12/2025,TOCHEN: CUTTING BEFORE EATING,"Limitation of the Prohibition We have seen that grinding or chopping is a Torah prohibition. We will see that there are various limitations that apply to tochen , allowing one to cut freely in certain cases. CLOSE TO THE MEAL: TWO QUALIFIER The following is a leniency, albeit somewhat limited, that can be applied to the prohibition of tochen . If one cuts food into smaller pieces right before eating, it is not considered tochen . Rather, it is part of the eating process. 731 We saw a similar concept in borer (see Day___). However, in order to use this leniency, there are two additional requirements: 1. As mentioned above, even if one will eat it immediately, he may not use a chopping implement. 732_. One must cut the food into pieces that are slightly bigger than one would ordinarily cut them on a weekday. 733 • Even if it is close to the meal, one may not make finely chopped car- rot salad on Shabbos. 734 First, the pieces are tiny. Second, one would likely have to use a grater. However, it is permissible to make a carrot salad with the same ingredients by cutting large pieces using a knife. • One may cut carrots and cabbage for a coleslaw salad right before a meal, but only with a knife, and only into pieces that are slightly bigger than usual. Bear in mind that “close to the meal” is defined in the same way as we defined it when discussing the melachah of borer (see Days___—116). That is, it must be done during the preparations for a meal that will commence thereafter___ (see there for more details). In summary, one avoids tochen by cutting the food right before eating, with a regular knife (not a chopping utensil), and into pieces that are slightly larger than usual.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"731.

155,26/12/2025,TOCHEN: COOKED WELL,"We are discussing various limitations of tochen . The first one is cutting the food a little bit bigger than usual right before eating it. Here are two others. Cooked Extremely Well Although finely chopping food is prohibited, one is permitted to chop it once it has already been well cooked such that it is very soft (again, provided that he is not using a grinding implement). 736 This is because the cooking pro- cess would have broken it down to the point that it is not one solid, and so, it is no longer deemed grinding. 737 The food needs to be so soft that it is spreadable, such that if one holds one end of it, the other end will flow outwards. • One may mush boiled apples onto other food. However, he may only do so with a knife, fork, or spoon, and not with a grater or other grinding implement. • One may take a soft, well-cooked potato from a pie or boureka and mush or spread it as he wishes. However, he may only do so with a knife, fork, or spoon, and not with a grater or other grinding implement. Note that the three conditions of borer apply before one can remove the potato. • Most jams are cooked and easy to spread. Although there may be pieces of strawberry or apricot inside, because they have been well cooked, one is permitted to spread or mush them onto bread on Shabbos. 738 It is worth mentioning that we will learn about a separate prohibition of memare’ach (smoothing). Although strictly speaking, this does not apply to spreading very soft, overcooked foods, there is a praiseworthy stringency of avoiding doing so. 739 • One may not mash an avocado or banana, as they are not cooked, and mashing them constitutes tochen . (Doing so close to one’s meal with a change [ shinui ] is permitted when necessary, as we have learned above.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"735. Mishnah Berurah  321:45.

156,27/12/2025,TOCHEN: NOT FROM THE GROUND;  LIMITATION OF LENIENCIES,"Not from the Ground___ The prohibition of tochen only applies to things that are from the ground, 741 such as fruit and vegetables, clumps of sand, and sticks (which are also muktzeh ). One is permitted to cut up meat, chicken, or fish as he wishes, although he may not use a grinding implement. • One is permitted to cut up cooked chicken for children or the elderly who are unable to chew it. However, he may not use a grater or any other specialized chopping implement. • One is allowed to chop eggs and cheese. Grinding Utensils We have learned some leniencies regarding tochen , but it is important to know that even when chopping is permitted, it may never be done with a chop- ping implement. 742 • One may never use a grinder or a blender (even nonelectric) on Shab- bos. • One is not allowed to use a knife that is dedicated to chopping those things that are forbidden to be chopped on Shabbos. • One may not use a dedicated chopping knife to chop lettuce. But one may use an egg slicer or a cheese slicer, since eggs and cheese are not included in the prohibition of grinding on Shabbos because they do not grow from the ground. 743",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"740.

157,28/12/2025,TOCHEN: FOODS THAT ARE MADE  FROM PREVIOUSLY CHOPPED-UP  MATERIAL,"We have discussed three limitations to the melachah of tochen , all of which are only permitted without a grinding implement. 1. If it is part of the eating process, one may cut up the food (not with a grinding utensil, and into slightly bigger than usual pieces) before eating it. 2. Anything that has been very well cooked such that it is no longer a real solid is permitted. 3. Only things that originate from the ground are included under tochen . We will now discuss another leniency: a food that was originally created through grinding and was reconstituted to form a solid is not included in the prohibition of tochen . 744 Once again, one may not use a grinding tool to do so. Importantly, one may not grind it again if there will be no semblance or benefit of the original grinding left afterwards. • One is permitted to break down (not with a grinder) bread, cake, or cookies into crumbs, as these foods are produced from previously ground flour. • One may chop up reconstituted salt or sugar cubes, 745 but not with a grinder. • In cases where it is permitted to take medicine, one may cut a pill in half, as it was made from ground powder. 746 However, one may not use a grinder, and one must avoid breaking the letters on the pill. Exceptions • It is forbidden to break up a clump of sand. 747 • One may not break up dried mud on a shoe. 748 (See the footnotes for more on this subject.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"744.

158,29/12/2025,TOCHEN: A DOUBLE SHINUI,"In general, the performance of a Torah prohibition in an abnormal way ( shinui ) is downgraded to a Rabbinical prohibition, but is still forbidden on Shabbos. There is one exception to this rule: grinding with a double shinui . If one grinds while changing two aspects of the way it is normally done — what is being used to cut and the surface on which one is cutting — it is permit- ted. 749 But one may only cut what will be used on Shabbos. 750 It is important to note that the change in the cutter or masher must be a real change from the norm. • Crushing peppercorns using a grinder or even a knife___ falls under the Torah prohibition of tochen . However, cutting them using the handle of a knife and doing so on the table or a plate (as opposed to a cutting board or mortar) is permitted. 752 It is worth mentioning that there are very few examples of this leniency mentioned in the Poskim , and thus, one should preferably consult a Rav before doing so. Spices We mentioned that it is permitted to cut something into bigger pieces than usual (with a knife, not a chopping implement) if one will eat it shortly. 753 How- ever, this does not apply to something that will not be eaten by itself, such as spices. It follows that one may not chop spices even if it is close to a meal, unless he applies a double shinui as we have specified above. • Today, there are salt, pepper, and herb blocks in containers that grind the block as the top is turned and consequently dispense ground spice. Using such a container falls under the Torah prohibition of tochen , as it is a grinding instrument. Furthermore, even cutting the peppercorns or cinnamon with a knife for or during a meal remains a Torah prohibition, as these are not eaten alone. 754 One would need to use a double shinui in order to use such spices.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"749.

In cases of need, it may be permitted. 756 We mentioned in the section on borer (selecting) that when there is no physical change in the item, there is a leniency with regard to an unintentional or unknowing transgression, and the food is permitted to all on Shabbos. 757 It could be argued that when cutting food into tiny pieces ( tochen ), there is no creative change, given that it is the same item in smaller pieces. However, the Mishnah Berurah does not accept this proposal, 758 and thus, there is no leniency. However, in a case of need, it is advisable to ask a Rav , as some Poskim___ permit it under certain circumstances. • The Mishnah Berurah rules that if one unintentionally cut onions into tiny pieces on Shabbos morning, long before the meal was due to take place, they are forbidden until after Shabbos.

160,31/12/2025,TOCHEN: FEEDING ANIMALS - BREAD,"Bread for Dependent Animals We have seen that tochen is permitted in regards to something that has already been chopped up and reconstituted (except in the case of food that is not eaten by itself). Thus, it is permitted to break up bread into tiny bits (by hand or using a knife, not with a grinder) to give to those animals that are dependent on their owners, or dogs. 772 This is because bread is made from flour that was ground. Shabbos Shirah There was a custom to give bread to the birds on the Shabbos of Parashas Beshalach , commonly known as Shabbos Shirah . 773 However, one should not do so, because it is a Rabbinic prohibition to feed ownerless birds. 774 Still, one may take the tablecloth (if it is dry) and shake it outside in a place where nothing can be planted, even though the birds may come and eat the crumbs. 775",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"759.

161,01/01/2026,DASH (EXTRACTING),"Introduction Part of the processing of wheat is to extract the grains from the sheaves that they are attached to. This is a melachah known as dash (extracting). The basic melachah can be defined as detaching or extracting an edible item from its source of growth. 776 However, only extracting that which would be ex- tracted on a farm or in a factory is prohibited. Anything that would normally be detached at home is permitted. 777 • One may not pick dates off of a cluster, as that is usually done on the farm or in the factory, before it gets to the store. 778 This act of detaching is considered professional, and is forbidden. • One may take grapes off of a cluster, as that is not usually done on the farm or in the factory. Shops never sell individual grapes. Therefore, because removing the grapes is something that is only done at home, it is permissible on Shabbos. 779 The same applies to removing a banana from the stem. 780 • Similarly, one may pick cherry tomatoes off of a bunch, as most stores sell them that way, not individually. Nuts Some nuts have two shells — a soft outer shell which is removed in the factories, and a harder inner shell which is usually cracked while eating. One may remove the shells of nuts. 781 However, one may not remove the outer green, soft shell of almonds, as this is usually removed in the field or at the factory. 782 Fortunately, this situation is quite uncommon today since it is very rare to buy a nut with the outer shell still on it. The General Rule One may detach the portion of any food that is already in a state in which it is normally sold and served at the table. However, the portion of any food that should have been detached at the farm or factory may not be detached. The practical applications of the av melachah of dash are relatively few. Still, the offshoots of dash are quite extensive, as we will soon see.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"776. Shabbos  73b.

162,02/01/2026,DASH: SQUEEZING FRUIT,"We have seen that the basic melachah of dash is removing an edible or usable item from its source of growth. One of the classic offshoots of this melachah is extracting juice from a fruit. Just as removing the grain from the sheaf is prohibited, so too removing juice from the fruit is also prohibited. This is known as sechita (squeezing). Categories___ Our Sages divided the fruits and vegetables that can be squeezed into three categories: 1. “Grapes and Olives” (fruits that are very commonly squeezed): the Torah Prohibition_. “Strawberries and Pomegranates, etc.” (fruits that are squeezed occa- sionally): a Rabbinic Prohibition_. “Other Fruit” (fruits that are never squeezed): permitted to be squeezed by hand, but not with a mixer or squeezer “Grapes and Olives” Grapes and olives are commonly grown for the production of wine and olive oil. Thus, extracting juice from grapes or olives constitutes a Torah pro- hibition. 784 • Making grape juice by stamping on grapes falls under the Torah pro- hibition of dash . • Squeezing grapes in order to drink their juice falls under the Torah prohibition of dash . Liquid from Grapes or Olives In order to prevent one from transgressing the above Torah prohibition of squeezing grapes and olives, Chazal also decreed that any juice that has flowed from them on Shabbos is prohibited, regardless of how the liquid was released from the fruit, and even if it flowed without any external action done to it. 785 • If one was cutting grapes for a fruit salad, the juice that remains on the plate may not be drunk. • If cut grapes were in a bowl and some of their juice flowed into the bowl, the juice that remains in the bowl may not be drunk.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"783.

163,03/01/2026,"DASH: SQUEEZING FRUIT, CONTINUED","We learned about the first, most stringent category of fruits in dash — “Grapes and Olives.” Let us now discuss the other two categories. “Strawberries and Pomegranates” It is Rabbinically prohibited to squeeze fruits that are grown to be eaten but are sometimes also squeezed for their liquid. Examples include oranges, lemons, grapefruit, carrots, pomegranates, and berries. 786 However, the juice that flows from these fruits is only prohibited if the person intended to squeeze them for their juice at some point. 787 Generally, most people intend to eat the fruits and not to squeeze them, therefore, the juice that flows from them is usu- ally permitted. • Although it is categorically prohibited to squeeze oranges, lemons, grapefruit, carrots, pomegranates, and berries, the juice that happens to flow from them is only forbidden if they were bought for the purpose of juicing. 788 • One may eat a grapefruit by spooning out the fruit. However, he must avoid deliberately squeezing it in order to extract juice. Also, he must not intend to extract the juice. 789 Fruits That Are Never Squeezed It is permitted to squeeze by hand fruits that are never squeezed. Today, almost all fruits are used for their juice at some point, and so, it is rare to find this type of fruit. • It is permitted for one to squeeze a raw cucumber on Shabbos, if he so desires. This prohibition only applies when squeezing onto a surface, into a dish, or onto a liquid. We will see that squeezing onto a solid is generally permissible. 790",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"786. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  5:11. Note that Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv in  Hilchos Shabbos  B’Shabbos  1:1:23 held that fruits that are very commonly squeezed are considered “squeezed  fruits” today, and fall under the Torah prohibition. According to this, it would also be Rabbinically  forbidden to drink from the liquid that flowed from them.

164,04/01/2026,DASH: SQUEEZING FOOD THAT IS  PICKLED OR BOILED - FOOD,"Food that is pickled or boiled is slightly different from regular fruits and vegetables. The juices within are generally not significant or desired by the one eating. 791 Nevertheless, there is a Rabbinic prohibition to squeeze them in order to drink the juice. 792 If one is squeezing because he does not want the liquid to be inside the fruit, it is permitted. 793 • One is permitted to squeeze a stewed apple in order to dry it out. How- ever, it is forbidden to squeeze it into a cup so that the apple juice can be drunk. Bear in mind that squeezing grapes and olives is always forbidden. Latkes, French Fries, and Meatball Gravy The same rule applies to the oil inside latkes or french fries, and the gravy in meatballs. If one squeezes the food in order to drain the liquid, it is permitted, but it is forbidden to do so for the sake of using the oil. 794 Sucking Juice from Fruit Sucking juice from a fruit is not a normal way of extracting juice. Therefore, most Poskim permit it, but still, one must not squeeze the fruit while sucking. 795 However, one should ideally be more stringent with grapes and olives, and thus only suck once they are already in his mouth. 796 • One can pop an olive into his mouth and suck the juice. However, he should not hold it in his hand and suck the juice from it. • One can hold other fruits, such as lemons, oranges, and grapefruit and suck the juice from them, being careful not to squeeze them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"791.

165,05/01/2026,DASH: SQUEEZING ONTO SOLIDS,"We have covered the prohibition of squeezing fruits (an offshoot of the melachah of dash ), and whether the prohibition is from the Torah or Rabbinic. Taking a Liquid from One Solid to Another When one removes the liquid, it is considered detaching a liquid from a solid, and this constitutes dash . However, when one squeezes a liquid directly on top of a solid, and the liquid is absorbed into the solid, such a liquid is actually considered a solid in its own right. This is because it has no true existence as a liquid, 797 and detaching a usable solid from another usable solid is permitted. 798 Thus, squeezing directly onto a solid is permitted — although it is praise- worthy to avoid doing so with grapes and olives. 799 However, one may not squeeze a liquid into a cup, even with the intention to pour it onto a solid afterwards — one may only squeeze from a solid direct- ly into a solid. 800 Even when this is permitted, one must not use a dedicated squeezing vessel. Note that the liquid must be mostly absorbed into the food that it fell onto. If it does not mostly integrate into the solid, it is prohibited. 801 Practical Applications Making a Salad Dressing Squeezing a lemon into a cup to make salad dressing is prohibited. 802 How- ever, squeezing a lemon onto a green salad and mixing it in is permitted, as the juice is considered part of the salad. 803 Squeezing a Lemon onto Fried Fish Squeezing a lemon into a cup is prohibited. However, one may squeeze a lemon directly onto a piece of fried fish (when it is not hot), as it will then be considered a solid. This is true even if the juice rests on top of the fish for a while, as that is the way that lemon juice integrates into the solid. 804 Remember that removing lemon seeds from the salad or fish constitutes the prohibition of borer , and must be dealt with using the three conditions of borer (see Day___). Lemon in Hot Water One may not squeeze a lemon into a cup of hot water, as it would constitute the prohibition of bishul . However, he may put the lemon into the tea if the tea is a kli shelishi (see Day__). Making Fruit Salad One may not squeeze oranges into a cup. Instead, one can squeeze (by hand, not with a squeezer) the juice from the orange directly onto a fruit salad. Mak- ing a fruit salad can constitute the melachah of tochen (grinding), so one may only do so close to the time of eating, using his hand or a knife (but not using utensils that are specialized for grinding or cutting) and cutting pieces that are larger than usual.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"797.

166,06/01/2026,DASH: MILKING AND NURSING,"Another form of removing or extracting a usable food from its source is milking or nursing. These both constitute the Torah prohibition of dash . 805 Milking an Animal One may not milk an animal on Shabbos. 806 If the animal is in pain and needs to be milked, there is a leniency to permit asking a non-Jew to milk it. 807 If there is no non-Jew available, there are certain extreme circumstances in which milking may be permitted, as long as the milk goes to waste — but one should consult a Rav before doing so. 808 Just as juice that came out from grapes or olives is forbidden on Shabbos, so too milk that came out of an animal (even if it was not actively milked) is also prohibited, and the milk is muktzeh . 809 Nursing Although a woman is permitted to nurse directly into the mouth of a baby, it is forbidden to pump milk (not just with an electric pump, but even manually) into a container to feed the baby afterwards. 810 If a woman is in pain from excess milk and needs to release it, she may not pump milk into an empty container. Rather, she must put an inedible substance (such as soap) into the container, so that the milk becomes unusable immediately as it drops in. 811 Electric Pump As we mentioned, it is forbidden for a woman to pump milk on Shabbos unless she is in great distress and it drips directly into a substance that renders it unusable immediately. This permit obviously only applies to a manual pump. An electric pump is prohibited, unless the situation is life-threatening. If there is a risk of the mother’s milk drying up if she doesn’t use a pump, she should consult a Rav .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"805.

167,07/01/2026,DASH: ICE AND SOAP,"Ice One is not permitted to crush ice, hail, or snow on Shabbos. 812 This is be- cause___ of molid , the prohibition of creating something new (by changing the ice from a solid to a liquid), and because it is similar to squeezing fruit (extracting one usable thing from another). 814 However, one may break off ice from a larger block, even if it leads to tiny fragments breaking off and causing droplets, because those tiny pieces are insignificant, undesired, and unintended. 815 One may also put ice directly into a cup of juice or water even though it will invariably melt. This is permitted because he did not actively chop the ice, and the melting is not a significantly recognizable difference (as it disappears into the liquid it is sitting in). Placing Frozen Things Where They Will Melt We have seen (in Day__) that it is forbidden to place a liquid in a place where it could reach___°F/43°C, 816 as leaving it in such a place constitutes the Rabbinic prohibition of bishul even if one plans to remove it before it reaches that temperature. We will now take this a step further. Ideally, one should not put ice or any frozen or congealed liquid (i.e., any liquid in solid form) near a heat source (or even under the hot sun), where it will become a liquid, because of molid . This is even the case if it will never possibly reach___°F/43°C. 817 Nevertheless, in cases of need, it is permissible. Certainly if one has done so by mistake, use of the ensuing liquid is permitted. Note that it is permitted if the ice or congealed substance is negligible (as long as it will not reach___°F/43°C). 818 • One may not place chicken that has masses of congealed gravy by the stove to melt, even if it is so far away that it may not possibly reach___°F/43°C. However, if the amount of congealed fat is negligible or will melt into the chicken and not form a visible puddle below, it is permitted to do so. A Bar of Soap There are a few reasons why using a bar of soap on Shabbos is forbidden, one of which is that dissolving it is similar to crushing ice. 819 We will discuss other problems with using a bar of soap in the melachah of memachek (in Day___). Liquid Soap One is permitted to use liquid body or hand soap on Shabbos, as it does not involve crushing anything, and it does not create anything new. 820",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"812.

168,08/01/2026,DASH: SOME LENIENCIES  REGARDING MELTING,"We have seen that one may not chop ice or place it near heat to melt it. Here are a few leniencies on the subject. Note that where defrosting is permitted in the cases below, it is only if one will use it on Shabbos. One may not apply these leniencies to defrost something for use after Shabbos. Removing Frozen Items from a Freezer One is allowed to remove frozen items from a freezer and leave them at room temperature. Ice That Has Melted Although it is prohibited to chop or melt ice, it is permitted to use it once it has melted. 821 (However, some Poskim recommend rather using water that has not been melted, if possible. 822 ) In Cases of Great Need In cases of need, one may place something frozen near heat (where it is not possible for it to reach___°F/43°C). 823 Milk Milk is unique as a liquid. When it is frozen, it still functions as milk (com- pared to water, which, when frozen, functions as ice). Therefore, one may place frozen milk near heat (only if it is impossible to reach___°F/43°C) for use on Shabbos. 824 Defrosting Ice Cream Similarly, one may defrost ice cream near heat in order to soften it (if it will not be possible for it to reach___°F/43°C), as melted ice cream is still viewed as ice cream. 825 Ices Although some Poskim are stringent regarding melting ices, one may cer- tainly be lenient if they are for children, and place them near heat (if they will not be able to reach___°F/43°C). 826 However, one may not crush them in order to make liquid. Putting Sugar and Coffee into Water Assuming that there are no applications of bishul (see Day__), one is per- mitted to put sugar or coffee into a hot liquid, even though it will dissolve. Walking on Snow or Hail One may walk on snow or hail even though it will cause it to melt. However, one may not purposely try to crush the snow or hail. 827",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"821. Mishnah Berurah  318:107.

169,09/01/2026,DASH: MORE ON ICE;  FREEZERS;   WATER COOLERS,"Once we are discussing ice, here are some related halachos regarding ice on Shabbos. Making Ice___ Preferably, one should fill ice trays and place them into the freezer before Shabbos. If there is an important need for it, one may do so even on Shabbos. Additionally, one may place something into the freezer to cool it down a bit, even if there is not a pressing need for it. Storing in the Freezer If food will get ruined by leaving it outside the refrigerator or freezer, one is permitted to store it there. 829 • One may place leftover Shabbos chicken into the freezer if it will be ruined by leaving it out. Making Ice Cream It is permitted to make ice cream on Shabbos (manually) and put it in the freezer to set if it will be used on Shabbos. 830 Note that making mixtures on Shabbos by combining solids and liquids may constitute the prohibition of lash (kneading). We will discuss these halachos in Days___—161. Taking out a Frozen Challah One may take out a frozen challah from the freezer to defrost, and one may even place it near heat (as it is a cooked solid). However, if there is frost on it, one must be sure that it cannot possibly reach___°F/43°C. 831 • If there is frost on a frozen challah, one may not place it on top of a hot plate to defrost, as this would constitute the prohibition of bishul . Similarly, one may not wrap it and place it into hot water unless the water is in a kli shelishi . Refrigerators and Freezers___ Many refrigerators and freezers have thermostats that regulate the tempera- ture based on the warm air that enters as the door is opened. Opening the door effectively causes the motor to begin cooling the air. Some Poskim say that one must disconnect the thermostat and keep the refrigerator or freezer on a timer, so that opening the door will have no effect on the thermostat. 833 Other Poskim say that one just needs to ensure that the motor is already running before opening the door. 834 Yet other Poskim allow one to open the door regardless. 835 However, this is regarding the motor. If, as one opens the door, the fan immediately switches off, or the defroster turns on, or the digital monitor im- mediately adjusts, or the light turns on, it is forbidden according to all Poskim to open or close the door . This is particularly problematic in modern refrigerators and freezers. Therefore, one must be certain to clarify whether his refrigerator or freezer is problematic, and remove such functions before Shabbos. If he did not, he will have to get a non-Jew to open and close the refrigerator or freezer for him, and only for Shabbos needs. 836 For more details on how to do so, see the halachos of asking non-Jews to do melachos in Days___—384. Water Coolers Water coolers use a thermostat, and often have the same issues as refriger- ators and freezers. Furthermore, if there is an option for hot water, it is possible that one may not use it at all (even for the cold water) on Shabbos. Again, one must check the specifications of each machine before using it. 837 Urinating on Ice, Snow, or Hail There is a dispute regarding whether urinating on ice, snow, or hail is prohib- ited, 838 because it would be considered actively melting ice. The Mishnah Berurah rules stringently, 839 and so one may only do so if there is no better option. Those shuls that put ice in urinals must find a better solution.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"828. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  10:4.

170,10/01/2026,HOTZAAH (CARRYING),"Four Different Areas Another melachah that was performed in the Mishkan is hotzaah — car- rying. Today, many dense Jewish communities have a functional eiruv , and so, the halachos of carrying may not be as applicable as they used to be. Still, there are many situations where one must know what to do, such as if one finds himself in one of those areas that do not have an eiruv , or when one is traveling for busi- ness or vacation. Indeed, these halachos are practical even for those who do live within an eiruv but are stringent not to rely on an eiruv at all. We will now discuss the basic principles of this melachah . There are four Halachic zones with regards to Shabbos: 840 • Two may be categorized as Torah-prohibited areas. • One is a Rabbinically-prohibited area. • One is an area where it is permitted to carry. Reshus HaYachid This is an area that is intended for use primarily by the individual. BASIC RULE: Carrying into or out from such an area may be a Torah prohibi- tion, but it is permitted for one to carry within this area. Any area that is_ tefachim by_ tefachim (1.1 square feet/0.1 square me- ters), and is fully enclosed by a fence or wall that is__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centimeters) high, is considered a reshus hayachid . 841 Examples include, but are not limited to: • A house, a courtyard, a walled-off street • Large movable items such as cars or closets (even if they are in public areas) • Large holes or mounds • Porches and roofs that are fenced off Reshus HaRabim This is an area used primarily by the public. BASIC RULE: Carrying into or out from such an area may be a Torah prohi- bition, and it is even forbidden to carry an item more than_ amos (6.3 feet/1.9 meters) within this area. Any publicly used area that is__ amos (25.2 feet/7.68 meters) or more in width, is not roofed, is open from one side to the other side, and___,000 people pass through it daily, is considered a reshus harabim . The height of a reshus har- abim extends to__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centimeters) high — thereafter, it is considered a makom ptur (a permitted area). 842 Examples of a reshus harabim include, but are not limited to: • A huge market thoroughfare • A large highway According to some opinions, even if___,000 people do not pass through daily, it is still considered a reshus harabim . The Mishnah Berurah rules that it is praiseworthy to be stringent like this opinion, 843 but one is permitted to rely on those that require___,000 for it to qualify as a Torah-prohibited area. Karmelis Chazal established a new category. Any area that is neither private nor public (according to the guidelines above), but resembles a public area, is considered a karmelis . BASIC RULE: Carrying into or out from this type of area may carry a Rabbinic prohibition, and it is also forbidden to carry more than_ amos (6.3 feet/1.9 meters) within this area. 844 Examples of a karmelis include, but are not limited to: • An open field, sea, river, or desert • Our suburban streets (according to the lenient opinion above that a street requires___,000 daily passersby in order to qualify as a reshus harabim ) Makom Ptur Any public area that is less than_ tefachim by_ tefachim (1.1 square feet/0.1 square meters) in space, and is more than_ tefachim (9.45 inches/24 centime- ters) above the ground or a ledge that is higher than__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centimeters) in a reshus harabim or karmelis , is permitted to carry in, by virtue of the fact that it does not qualify as a domain. 845 Examples include: • A tiny ledge in a suburban street that is__.5 inches/80 centimeters above the ground",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"840.

171,11/01/2026,HOTZAAH: THREE BASIC RULES  OF CARRYING,"We saw that there are two zones that carry a possible Torah prohibition for carrying: a private, enclosed domain ( reshus hayachid ), and an open, public domain ( reshus harabim ). We also saw that Chazal established a third zone, a karmelis (semi-public area). We discussed a fourth zone, which is a permitted area because it is so small, and does not qualify as a domain ( makom ptur ). Three Rules of Transferring Objects Obviously, carrying to and from the two Torah zones may constitute a Torah prohibition. Whenever the Rabbinic zone is involved, it can only constitute a Rabbinic prohibition. Here are the basic rules: 1. There are two possible Torah prohibitions with regards to carrying: a. Carrying an item from one Torah zone to another constitutes the Torah melachah of hotzaah . 846 • One may not carry a book from his house to a busy public area like Times Square or a highway, 847 or vice versa. It makes no dif- ference whether one carries in his hand, in his pockets, dragging it on the ground, or even throwing it. 848 b. Carrying an item for more than_ amos (6.3 feet/1.9 meters) with- in a reshus harabim (public area) also constitutes the Torah melachah of hotzaah . 849 • One may not carry a tallis bag in a busy public area, such as a highway or a busy open market, even if it was in that public place from before Shabbos. If he carries it for_.3 feet/1.9 meters, it constitutes the Torah melachah of hotzaah . 2. There are two primary Rabbinic prohibitions regarding hotzaah : a. One may not carry an item from a Torah-prohibited area ( reshus harabim or reshus hayachid ) to a karmelis , or vice versa. 850 • One may not carry his tallis from his house (a reshus hayachid ) to a small suburban street (a karmelis ), or vice versa. • One may not carry his tallis from Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, New York (a reshus harabim ) to a public park on the street (a karmelis ), or vice versa. b. One may not carry an item within a karmelis (semi-public area). One who carries an item for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters trans- gresses the Rabbinic prohibition of hotzaah . • One may not carry a bag in a suburban street even if it was there before Shabbos. If one carries it for more than_.3 feet/1.9 me- ters, he has transgressed the Rabbinic prohibition of hotzaah . • One may not carry a towel on a beach, even if it was there from before Shabbos. If one carries it for more than_.3 feet/1.9 me- ters, he has transgressed the Rabbinic prohibition of hotzaah . 3. One is always permitted to carry an item to or from a makom ptur (permitted area). However, one may not pass through a makom ptur with an item from one prohibited area to another prohibited area . • One can take an apple from his house and put it directly onto a tiny mailbox that is more than__.5 inches/80 centimeters off the ground. But he cannot put it on the mailbox, and from there, put it in the street or in a house.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"846. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  346:1.

172,12/01/2026,HOTZAAH: DEFINING “CARRYING”,"We have seen that: • Carrying from one Torah zone to another may constitute a Torah pro- hibition. • Carrying from or to a Rabbinic zone may constitute a Rabbinic pro- hibition. • Carrying to or from a makom ptur is permitted, so long as one does not use it as a resting place in order to get to another zone. • Carrying for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters in a reshus harabim (public area) constitutes a Torah prohibition. • Carrying for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters in a karmelis (semi-public area) constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Note that throughout our discussion of hotzaah , the phrase “going out” or “outside” refer to an area that is prohibited and there is no eiruv . What Is Considered Carrying? According to the Torah, “carrying” is defined as transferring a stationary ob- ject from one area to another, or transferring it_.3 feet/1.9 meters within a public domain. In other words, there must be an act of picking up (effectively removing it from a stationary position) and a “putting down” (effectively returning it to a stationary position elsewhere). Moreover, even if one stands in one domain and picks up an item, and extends the item out into another zone, it is already considered carrying Rabbinically. 851 Any time that either element, “picking up” or “putting down,” is lacking, it is not a Torah prohibition, but it will usually remain a Rabbinic one, even if one of these actions is performed by a non-Jew. • If one passes a cold drink from inside an apartment to someone standing outside on a street that has the status of a reshus harabim (see Day___ for this definition), he has transgressed the Torah melachah . • If one person only did the picking up and someone else did the putting down, it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 852 • If one took an item from his house to the highway and returned to the house without stopping, he has not transgressed the Torah prohibition, as the item was not fully transferred to the reshus harabim . However, he has still transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition. • If a non-Jew delivers something to a Jew (without transgressing a melachah ), he must put it down himself. It is prohibited for the Jew to pick it up. 853 An Item on One’s Person An item that is on one’s person has the same status as the person himself. That is, if the person is stationary, the item is considered stationary. If the person moves, the item is considered moving. 854 • If a person who has a bag on his back walks from his house to a quiet street (a karmelis ) and stops there to chat with his friend or wait for a traffic light, he has transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition, even though the item has not moved from his back. Less Than_ Amos We have seen that the Torah prohibition is transgressed when one carries an item for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters in a reshus harabim . Chazal decreed that it is prohibited even if one stops moving and then starts again. They also forbade doing so in a karmelis (semi-public area). In certain cases of extreme necessity, one may do this using many people, each carrying the item for less than_.3 feet/1.9 meters. Determining a case in which this leniency is applied is beyond the scope of this work, and a Rav should be consulted. • If one picks up a box of chocolates in a reshus harabim and carries it for_.3 feet/1.9 meters, he has transgressed the Torah prohibition of hotzaah . If he stops after_.3 feet/1 meter and starts again, he has trans- gressed a Rabbinic prohibition. • One may not move a baby stroller outside the eiruv by stopping and starting. In summary, it is usually at least Rabbinically prohibited to transfer an item from one prohibited zone to another, or to carry an item within a reshus harabim or karmelis .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"851.

173,13/01/2026,HOTZAAH: LEAVING THE HOUSE WITH  AN ITEM IN ONE’S POCKET,"Checking Garments Before Shabbos There is a special mitzvah to check one’s pockets on Friday afternoon, in order to avoid carrying anything on Shabbos. 855 It is also important to check one’s garments on Shabbos before going outside an eiruv . 856 Items that are utterly insignificant need not be removed. • Bits of laundered, broken tissue, lint, or dirt need not be removed. How- ever, small stones or coins must be removed. 857 Inadvertently Carrying an Item That Is Not Valuable If one did not check his garments, and unknowingly left his house to a non- eiruv area with an item in his garment, he has a problem: if he keeps going, he will be carrying an item for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters in a prohibited area, but if he stops, he will be transferring an item from one zone to another — he must not stop, because the transgression is only complete when an item is sta- tionery in a new domain. The following are his options, in order of preference: If He Has Not Yet Stopped, Then, While He Is Walking: • The best thing to do is to drop the item onto a makom ptur that is less than_.3 feet/1.9 meters from him, such as a small ledge or rock. See Day___ for measurements of a makom ptur . 858 • He should throw it out in an abnormal way (like inverting his pocket). 859 • He should ask a friend to stop and start with him for every few feet, and return it home in that way, making certain that neither of them carries the item for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters at a time. 860 • If all of these are not possible, he should run back to the place where he left from (without stopping along the way) and drop it in an abnormal fashion. If He Already Stopped: • He should drop the item onto the ground in an abnormal fashion. Inadvertently Carrying a Valuable Item If the item is valuable, the best thing to do is, while walking, in order of preference: 861 • He should place it on a makom ptur and guard it until after Shabbos, or get a non-Jew to watch it over Shabbos. • While walking, he should give it to a non-Jew to take to his house. • If there is no other option, the person himself can stop and start every few feet, making certain that he never carries the item for more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters at a time. Regardless of what method one uses, he must put it down abnormally when he arrives at his destination.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"855. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  252:7.

174,14/01/2026,HOTZAAH: CARRYING WITHIN  PRIVATE DWELLINGS,"Carrying within a Reshus HaYachid Owned by a Jew We have seen that carrying from one domain to another is forbidden. Car- rying inside a private domain ( reshus hayachid ) is permitted if it is owned by one person or group. • Jewish hospital patients can carry within a Jewish hospital, as all of the food is under the ownership of the hospital, and they are dependent on it. • Jewish soldiers in the IDF are permitted to carry on an enclosed army base, as they are all dependents of the Jewish “owners” of the army. 862 The same is true for campers on a fully fenced Jewish campsite. Carrying from One Reshus HaYachid to Another One is permitted to carry from one reshus hayachid to another if he owns them both. However, if there is an area in between that he does not own, it is forbidden to carry through it unless he makes an eiruv chatzeiros (see below) or rents it together with the owner of the domain in the middle. • One may carry from his house to his fully fenced garden, because he owns them both. • One may carry from a shul to the courtyard of the shul if they both belong to the community. 863 • Parents who rent two hotel rooms (one for them and one for their chil- dren) that are separated by another room or a corridor, may not carry from one to the other. If a room in between is owned by a Jew, the two families can make an eiruv chatzeiros in order to carry between rooms. The same would apply to the hallways if all the families renting in the hotel make an eiruv chatzeiros together. If the room or corridor belongs to a non-Jew, it also has to be rented from him. A Summary of the Halachos of Eiruv Chatzeiros The details of the halachos of eiruv chatzeiros are discussed in Days___— 150. Here is a summary: • If the other dwellers are Jews, they must all give bread or contribute to the cost of a large loaf, and place the bread in one of the rooms, signi- fying joint ownership. • If there is a resident who is not a Jew, the Jews must also rent the non- Jew’s apartment from him, to signify ownership.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"862.

175,15/01/2026,HOTZAAH: CARRYING ABNORMALLY  AND WEARING UNNECESSARY  CLOTHES,"We have defined the Torah prohibition of hotzaah as carrying an item from a public domain to a private domain or vice versa, or carrying more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters in the public domain. Carrying Normal Items in a Normal Way Torah prohibitions of Shabbos are only transgressed if they are performed in a normal way and done with normal things. If something is carried in an ab- normal way, or it is something that is not usually carried, it is downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition. Carrying abnormally in a karmelis (semi-public area, such as a quiet suburban street) is still a Rabbinic prohibition. One of the reasons that it is important to define a prohibition as Torah or Rabbinic is because Rabbinic prohibitions may be permitted when com- bined with other factors or circumstances, such as via a non-Jew, or in cases of great need. • One who carries a candy in his pocket or in his mouth in a reshus har- abim transgresses a Torah prohibition because it is a normal way of carrying. However, carrying a golf ball in one’s mouth is a Rabbinic prohibition because it is not normal to carry in such a way. Wearing Clothes One can certainly wear clothes in the public domain, as clothes are con- sidered part of the person when it is normal to wear them. 864 In fact, one is permitted to wear as many garments on top of each other as he wishes, even with the sole intent to transfer them to another domain, so long as each gar- ment would theoretically provide benefit to a person in its own right. 865 Thus, a jacket on top of a jacket is permitted, even if one’s intention is to give it to another person. However, wearing a second garment that has no benefit in any way, such as a hat on top of a hat or a belt on top of a belt (without anything between them), is forbidden. Wearing a hat over a yarmulke (skullcap) is permitted. 866 Similarly, a person can wear garments on top of his normal clothes if they serve a purpose, such as a doctor’s coat that is worn over his regular clothing. 867 Included in permitted clothing are things that protect the body, such as a raincoat or winter coat. Earmuffs and gloves are also permitted. 868 One can even wear winter clothes during the summer, as they are still considered normal clothes. Items that people wear for beauty or style are also considered clothing, and are permitted. Examples include jewelry and ties. (See Day___ for more details.) Men may not wear women’s clothes, and vice versa (this is generally forbid- den during the week as well). It should be noted that wearing clothes that are likely to be taken off or fall off in the course of walking should be avoided. 869 Therefore, one who wears a hat should only go out with it if it will withstand a normal wind of the current season, or should tie it down without making a real knot. 870 Alternatively, it is permitted to go out with a hat if one is not wearing any other head covering, so that if the hat falls off, there is no worry that he will carry it in the public domain without replacing it on his head.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"864.

176,16/01/2026,HOTZAAH: ACCESSORIES,"We have been discussing the subject of garments that one may or may not wear in a reshus harabim or karmelis without an eiruv . In general, anything that is normally worn is permitted, and anything that is abnormal to wear or is worn in an abnormal fashion is prohibited. Furthermore, something that is likely to be removed or fall off is forbidden. As mentioned, our discussion of hotzaah refers to places where there is no eiruv . Tallis One is permitted to wear a tallis in the same way that he normally performs the mitzvah (even though he is wearing a tallis katan underneath, and he may not be technically adding to the mitzvah). However, one may not wear it as a scarf, and he may certainly not carry it. 871 Wearing a tallis is not a mitzvah for everyone. A woman who wears a tallis on Shabbos in a reshus harabim transgresses the Torah prohibition of hotzaah . She is also prohibited Rabbinically from wearing it in a karmelis if there is no eiruv . 872 Women’s Head Coverings A married woman must go out wearing a head covering, such as a tichel , hat, or wig. This is even if it is held down with a needle or clip. A woman who is not married is also allowed to wear these. 873 Eyeglasses One is allowed to wear eyeglasses, since they are considered part of the person, and are also unlikely to fall off unexpectedly. 874 This includes eyeglasses that are not needed medically, which the person wears just to be fashionable. However, one should not carry reading glasses, nor should he wear them, as he is likely to remove them during the walk. Bifocal glasses are permitted, as one will not likely remove them. 875 Sunglasses and Lenses One can only go out wearing sunglasses if they are required medically. In this way, there is no likelihood that he will remove them. One is permitted to wear glasses that have sun shields clipped on. Similarly, glasses that turn dark in the sun and remain clear indoors are permitted, as one is unlikely to remove them. 876 Someone who is still unused to wearing contact lenses may not go out with them. 877 Bandages Whatever is necessary for the body is Halachically considered part of it. Thus, one is permitted to go out with a bandage that is there to protect or heal a wound. The same goes for an elastic cast that assists one’s muscles. However, a bandage that is there merely to prevent one’s clothes from getting bloodstained is forbidden. 878 False Teeth and Braces One is permitted go out with false teeth. One can even go out wearing retain- ers (that maintain the orthodontic work). Obviously, one may not carry them outside. Head gear associated with braces may also be worn. 879",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"871. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  301:29.

177,17/01/2026,HOTZAAH: GARMENTS FOR  PROTECTION,"We have been discussing wearing garments in a place where it is forbidden to carry: either a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . We said that the general rule is that anything that is normal to wear is permitted. Anything that is abnormal to wear or is worn abnormally is forbidden. Furthermore, something that is likely to be removed is also forbidden. Items That Protect One is allowed to wear items that prevent discomfort, whether physical or emotional. However, the item must be something that is worn, that is, attached to a person or his clothing. 880 • One can go out with earmuffs or silicone ear plugs to protect his ears from the cold. • A woman can go out wearing sanitary accessories, as they are there to prevent her from being uncomfortable or embarrassed. • Most Poskim rule that a woman who is wearing a moch should ideally not go out with it. 881 However, some Poskim allow it. 882 Covers for Hats and Shoes We have seen that anything protecting one’s body is permitted. However, something that is merely protecting one’s clothing is forbidden, unless it can be considered a garment in its own right. There is a dispute regarding whether the plastic cover of a hat is a garment in its own right, or just protection for a garment. One should be stringent___ unless he is also getting some bodily protection from it. 884 Regarding covering one’s shoes with plastic bags, it depends on the benefi- ciary. If it is solely for the sake of the shoes, it is forbidden. If it also benefits his feet, he can be lenient and use them outside. It follows that wearing a plastic bag on one’s hat, which is certainly not a garment, is forbidden according to all opinions. However, if it is also there to protect one’s face from the elements, there is room to be lenient. 885 (This can be determined by verifying whether the face would be protected without the bag present.) One may not cut a hole in a bag on Shabbos for this purpose. Watches A watch that is worn for aesthetic purposes (i.e., if it would stop, one would continue to wear it) is permitted according to all opinions. A watch that is worn for the time (i.e., one would not wear it if it stops) is subject to a dispute, and one who wishes to be stringent should not wear it. 886",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"880.

178,18/01/2026,HOTZAAH: PRIMARY ITEMS AND  SECONDARY ITEMS,"We have discussed the following rules regarding carrying in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv : • Anything that is normal to wear is permitted. Anything that is abnormal to wear or is worn abnormally is forbidden. • Anything that is likely to be removed is forbidden. • Anything that is worn or attached to garments or people in order to prevent discomfort, whether physical or emotional, is permitted. How- ever, something that merely protects one’s garment is forbidden, unless it also serves as a garment in its own right. Keys One is not permitted to carry keys. One may also not attach them to his belt. However, if one attaches the key in a way that it is part of the belt, and is therefore Halachically like the belt itself, it is permitted to take outside. This can be done in one of two ways: 1. One can use the key to replace the buckle. Both edges of the belt would have rings that are looped into the key. 2. One can use the key to join two parts of the belt, such as when the two pieces of leather have rings that loop into the key to form one long belt, and the normal buckle remains. Wearing such a belt is permitted because the combination of the leather and the key is now a usable garment. 887 Note that one may not make a knot when tying the edges of the belt to the key. Instead, one can make a bow. Safety Pins If a garment is being held together with a safety pin, the safety pin is con- sidered part of the garment. One can go out with safety pins if they are serving a purpose for the garment that they are attached to. 888 Part of a Garment Whatever is normally attached to a garment is nullified to it and is not con- sidered existent in its own right. One is not considered to be carrying such an item when it is attached to a garment. 889 • One is permitted to wear a raincoat even if he is not wearing the hood. The hood is a secondary item that is generally attached to the raincoat, and it is nullified to the raincoat. 890 • One can wear shoes with shoelaces, even if the shoelaces are not tied at the moment. This is because shoelaces are part of the shoes, and are not considered to have an existence separate from the shoes when they are laced into them. Tallis with Broken or Missing Strings In order to wear a four-cornered garment, it needs to have valid tzitzis strings tied on beforehand. If one finds that any tzitzis strings are missing or broken, the remaining strings are not considered to be part of the tallis (as they actually invalidate it from being worn), and the garment may not be worn or carried in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . 891 If one does not intend to use the remaining valid strings, they are nullified to the rest of the garment, and can be worn until he gets home. 892 (At that point, one is no longer permitted to be wearing the garment, even indoors, as one may not wear a four-cornered garment that does not have valid strings.) One should always check the tzitzis strings before donning a tallis (even on a weekday). 893 Tallis Katan at Night or When One Is Hot A tallis katan (commonly known as tzitzis, referring to the small undergar- ment with tzitzis strings) may be worn outside on Shabbos night, even though the obligation of tzitzis does not apply at night. Furthermore, it may even be worn in hot weather.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"887. Rama ,  Orach Chaim  301:1;  Mishnah Berurah  301:45;  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  18:49.

179,19/01/2026,HOTZAAH: LABELS;  BUTTONS;   DISABILITY ASSISTANCE,"We have covered many of the practical halachos of what may and may not be carried in a reshus harabim or a karmelis that does not have an eiruv . The general rule is that if something is not a garment or is not nullified to a garment, it is included in the prohibition against carrying. Walking Sticks and Crutches If a person is dependent on something in order to walk, he can go out with it even in a reshus harabim or a karmelis that does not have an eiruv . Therefore, a person who is reliant on a walking stick or crutches is permitted to use them as he walks. However, he may not carry them outside. Note that if one usually walks around the house without them, and wishes to use them outside for additional support, he is not allowed to go out with them. 894 A blind person may go out with his stick, unless he knows his route perfectly well. 895 Wheelchair There are differing views regarding one who is wheelchair bound. Rav Moshe Feinstein viewed a wheelchair in the same category as a walking stick or crutches, and the same rules would apply. 896 However, it should be noted that according to all opinions, a healthy person may not push a person in a wheelchair in an area that does not have an eiruv . Extra Buttons One must always check new suits and jackets for the loose buttons that they come with, as carrying those is a melachah . However, if extra buttons are sewn well into the garment, they are not a problem. Also, the buttons attached at the bottom of a shirt are not an issue. 897 Clips for Head Coverings The clips that are required for head coverings (such as tichels and yarmulkes ) are considered necessary for the garments that they serve, and one may go out with them. However, one may not go out with clips that are not being used or are unnecessary. Labels Attached to Clothing Things that one would ordinarily remove are considered extra, and if so, may not be taken outside. Therefore, labels that state “ Shatnez approved” or cleaning instructions are permitted, because they are generally not removed during the life of the garment. However, one may not go out with attached price tags, as people are always particular to remove them. If a dry-cleaning tag is in a place that bothers the person wearing the garment to the point that he would want them removed, they are considered extra, and he may not go out with them attached. If it does not bother him, and he merely forgot to remove it, it is permitted. 898 One may undo a staple on Shabbos, but not stitching (see also Day___). Firearms and Ammunition One may only carry firearms and ammunition if there is a real concern of danger. A Rav should be consulted. 899",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"894.

180,20/01/2026,HOTZAAH: MEDICAL ITEMS  AND JEWELRY,"We have covered many of the practical halachos of what may and may not be carried in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . The general principle is that something that is not a garment, is not nullified to a garment, or should have been removed beforehand is considered like something extra, and carrying it is forbidden. For Medical Purposes Band-Aids and elastic guards are necessary for one’s health, and are nullified to the body. Thus, one is permitted to go out with them on, so long as they are attached and genuinely beneficial. One may also wear a sling that is supporting a fractured, dislocated, or sprained limb, as it is directly benefiting the body. 900 Jewelry Jewelry is a direct adornment of the body, and in this way, is considered similar to the medical items above. Thus, jewelry may be worn outside. However, it must be worn, not carried as an accessory. 901 One may not wear jewelry that is unique to the opposite gender. 902 It is preferable for a man to avoid wearing jewelry that is not unique to either gender in a reshus harabim or a karmelis that does not have an eiruv . 903 • A woman may wear a diamond ring. A man may not. • It is preferable that a man not wear a plain silver chain outside. • A woman may not carry a handbag even though it is part of her “look.”",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"900.

181,21/01/2026,HOTZAAH: INSIGNIFICANT ITEMS; CARRYING PEOPLE AND ANIMALS,"CARRYING INSIGNIFICANT ITEMS Very small items that have no significance in their own right can be carried in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv so long as one does not specif- ically have a use for them in the future. 904 However, things that are insignificant in nature but are large in size are Rab- binically prohibited. 905 • Small bits of crushed paper or tissue in one’s pockets (from a washing machine) are not included in the melachah of hotzaah , unless one has specifically attached some importance to them. 906 • One can walk in rain or snow, because the moisture and snow that he is carrying on his clothing are insignificant and irrelevant. The same ap- plies to small leaves that fall on one’s garments. However, if one collected a snow ball, he may not carry it, because it is significant. • If a stone falls into one’s shoe, creating discomfort, it is likely that he intends to remove it. This grants it significance, albeit negative. He may not continue walking while the stone is in his shoe. 907 • If one has just eaten a meal, and there are bits of food stuck in his teeth, he may go outside without removing them. However, if the pieces are disturbing him, it is likely that he will eventually remove them. This grants them negative significance. In this case, he must remove the food from his teeth before going outside. 908 Carrying People Until now, we have discussed the halachos of carrying inanimate objects in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . We will now discuss the halachah regarding carrying people and animals. Adults The melachos of Shabbos are based on the acts that took place in the Mishkan. In the Mishkan, only inanimate objects were carried. Furthermore, when a person is carried, he has the ability to carry a portion of his own weight. 909 Therefore, there is no Torah prohibition to carry an adult in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . 910 However, there is still a Rabbinic prohibition to do so. 911 • Even if someone is very tired, it is forbidden for his friend to pick him up and carry him in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . Children, the Sick, and the Handicapped People who are unable to walk to some degree are Halachically considered inanimate regarding the halachos of hotzaah , and carry the same Torah prohi- bition as inanimate objects. 912 • Carrying a baby or an ill person in a reshus harabim carries the Torah prohibition of hotzaah . Obviously, if there is any danger to life, one must do whatever is necessary to save it. • Carrying someone who is tied up in a reshus harabim carries the Torah prohibition of hotzaah . Baby Strollers Like any other item, moving an empty baby stroller outside is certainly prohibited. Even if a person is inside it, it is prohibited. However, whether the prohibition is a Torah or Rabbinic one depends on the person inside, as the carriage is nullified to the person it is carrying. 913 • If the child inside a stroller can walk, the one who pushes the stroller is transgressing a Rabbinic prohibition even if he is in a reshus harabim . However, if the child cannot walk (either because he is too young or be- cause he is sick), the one who pushes it in a reshus harabim transgresses the Torah prohibition of hotzaah . Assisting a Child’s Walking One is permitted to help a child walk outside, so long as he does not drag him or lift him entirely off of the ground. In other words, only when one foot is on the ground and the other foot is moving forward in the air is assisting permitted, but not when both feet are being dragged on the ground or off of the ground. 914 Carrying Animals Unlike people, animals are considered inanimate objects for the purposes of hotzaah . 915 Thus, anyone who carries an animal through a reshus harabim or between a reshus harabim and reshus hayachid transgresses a Torah prohibition. In addition, animals are usually muktzeh .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"904. Based on  Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  350:3 and  Mishnah Berurah  326:23.

182,22/01/2026,HOTZAAH: GETTING A NON-JEW  TO CARRY A CHILD,"We have seen that carrying a person who is incapable of walking constitutes the Torah prohibition (in a reshus harabim ). However, carrying a child who can walk is a Rabbinic prohibition. One practical ramification of this difference involves the permissibility of getting a non-Jew to carry the child. Getting a Non-Jew to Push or Carry a Child We have seen that one may not push a baby stroller, even if it has a child inside. If one who is in a karmelis needs to bring his baby someplace, he may, under certain conditions, ask a non-Jew to do so for him. We have defined a karmelis as a place where___,000 people do not pass daily. Carrying in a karmelis without an eiruv constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Asking or benefiting from the act of a non-Jew also constitutes a Rabbinic pro- hibition. Therefore, since there are two Rabbinic prohibitions, if there is a need for the child to be at shul, one is permitted to ask a non-Jew to push or carry the child to shul. 916 This is based on the principle of a double d’Rabbanan in a case of need, 917 which we will discuss in the chapter of halachos of benefiting from melachos of non-Jews (see Days___—372). • One may ask a non-Jew to carry a child to shul in order to daven, or if he is afraid to leave the child at home alone, or because the family was invited out after shul, if the way to shul is in a karmelis . This is permitted even if the child cannot walk by himself. Note that the non-Jew must pick up and put down the child himself. One may not directly give or take the child from him at any point. 918",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"916. Mishnah Berurah  308:154.

183,23/01/2026,VACATIONING ON SHABBOS,"Carrying Where There Is No Eiruv Before discussing the halachos of Shabbos that pertain to vacationing, let us briefly summarize the principles of carrying without an eiruv . There are two main Torah prohibitions: 1. Carrying from a reshus hayachid (private area) to a reshus harabim (public area) and vice versa_. Picking up an item in a reshus harabim (public area), carrying it more than_.3 feet/1.9 meters , and putting it down In addition, Chazal extended this prohibition to include areas that are not enclosed, but are also not exactly public either, known as a karmelis . Most of our streets, parks, and fields fall into this category, and thus the above two pro- hibitions apply there too. (Obviously, these halachos pertain to an area where there is no eiruv . If there is an eiruv , the whole area that it covers assumes the status of an enclosed area, and one can carry whatever is necessary there.) Ensuring That Everyone Owns Everything (Where All Residents Are Observant Jews) Non-Shared Ownership Assuming that there is no eiruv , one may only carry to and from an enclosed area if it belongs to all of the dwellers in that area. If there are multiple owners or residents in the dwelling, carrying to or from the enclosed area is forbidden. (Carrying things within the enclosed area is permitted.) • One may not carry from one private unit in an apartment building to the corridor or stairs (and certainly not to another unit), even if it is in the same building, unless the shared area is owned by everyone. 919 • If five families rent all five units in an apartment building or hotel, they may not carry from one to the other, nor to the complex’s patio, lobby, or corridor. Eiruv Chatzeiros This last issue can be resolved by making an eiruv chatzeiros . This is a Rab- binic enactment through which all residents take collective ownership of the entire building. The process is as follows. One collects a bread roll from each of the residents, and places them in one of the rooms or apartments, signifying that “we all are joint owners (or renters) of this building.” Alternatively, one of the residents can give a large loaf of bread (at least_.1 pounds/0.5 kilograms) to another one of the residents, who accepts it on the behalf of everyone in the building. There is a declaration for the giver to make, after which he hands the bread to the receiver. The giver then makes a brachah , and the recipient raises it__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centimeters) 920 high, as an acceptance on the behalf of all of the other owners or renters. The recipient then places it in one of the dwellings, to which everyone can have access over Shabbos. 921 • Five observant Jewish families take all five apartments in a building. In order to carry in the shared areas and to and from each other, they must each give a small roll to someone, who places them all in one of the apartments. Once all the rolls have been collected, one of the residents must say the declaration and make a brachah . 922 Or • One of them gives a large loaf or matzah (at least_.1 pounds/0.5 kilo- gram) and takes it to a fellow renter. He makes a declaration and gives it to him, and recites the brachah . The receiver raises it__.5 inches/80 centimeters, and places it in one of the apartments that can be accessed over Shabbos. The declaration and brachah are printed in most siddurim. It is important to note that these rules only apply if everyone in the building is an observant Jew. The halachos when there are non-Jews or Jews who publicly do not keep Shabbos in the building differ and will be discussed next.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"919.

184,24/01/2026,VACATIONING ON SHABBOS:  A BUILDING WITH NON-JEWS,"We have discussed the halachos of eiruv chatzeiros when all residents of a shared building are observant Jews. The halachah is different when there are non-Jews or nonobservant Jews___ (in this case, we define nonobservant as those who publicly do not keep Shabbos). 924 A Single Non-Jew or Nonobservant Jew in the Building If there is even one non-Jewish or nonobservant Jew living in the building, an eiruv chatzeiros would not allow carrying in the communal areas of the building or between apartments. This is because an eiruv does not work for those who do not keep Shabbos. 925 The solution is to rent their residences from them. In this way, it is consid- ered a Jewish residence over Shabbos, and the non-Jews or nonobservant Jews will be considered visitors. Renting One can pay a nominal amount to the non-Jew or nonobservant Jew for the right to use___ or access his residence. 927 It need not be a true rental amount — a small amount like a dollar will do. It also does not need to be in writing — a verbal agreement is sufficient. 928 One must then make an eiruvchatzeiros with the remaining observant Jews in the building. The eiruv may only be done after concluding the rental agreement with the non-Jew or nonobservant Jew. But an eiruv chatzeiros with other people must be done before Shabbos, not on Shabbos. 929 If the only other resident is the non-Jew and one forgot to rent his dwelling before Shabbos, he may make a verbal agreement with him on Shabbos, and pay him with food, but not with money. 930 If He Refuses to Rent If the non-Jew or non-observant Jew does not agree to rent his apartment for Shabbos, one can negotiate the right to place an object there over Shabbos, which would be Halachically considered partial ownership of that residence over Shabbos. 931 Negotiating with the Building’s Owner Instead of renting from or negotiating with each non-Jew or nonobservant Jew in the building, one can do so with the owner of the building instead. How- ever, this is only if that owner has the right to enter each unit as he wishes. Individual Negotiation One must rent from or negotiate with every non-Jewish and nonobservant Jew in the building or complex. The rest of the observant Jews then make a single eiruv chatzeiros , but only after renting or negotiating with the non-Jews and nonobservant Jews. • Five observant Jewish families go on vacation to an apartment complex in a place that does not have an eiruv . There are also two other families staying in the building — one is not Jewish, and the other one is Jewish, but nonobservant. If they wish to carry in the communal areas of the building, one of the observant families must rent the apartments of both the non-Jews and the nonobservant Jews, or negotiate the right to place an object in each of their units. They can also rent or negotiate with the owner of the building, if he has the right to enter each apartment if he needs to. Then, the observant families make an eiruv chatzeiros with each other. These are basic guidelines. One should consult a Rav if necessary.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"923. Mishnah Berurah  385:5. An  eiruv  does not work with non-Jews present, as  Chazal  decreed  that it is prohibited to live together with them. An  eiruv  does not work for nonobservant Jews, as  they do not accept Shabbos themselves.

185,25/01/2026,VACATIONING ON SHABBOS:  CARRYING IN A RESORT OR COMPLEX  WITH OPEN AREAS,"We have seen that one may not carry inside the communal areas of a building or complex of observant Jews (in a place that is located in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv ) unless he makes an eiruv chatzeiros . We also saw that in a building or complex with non-Jews or nonobservant Jews, the observant families may not make an eiruv chatzeiros until one rents the properties of the non-Jews or nonobservant Jews or negotiates the right to place something in each of their residences over Shabbos. A Walled Compound Many people erroneously think that a fenced or walled-in complex or resort is considered a private dwelling (like a house), and carrying is permitted inside of it. This is wrong. If there are only observant Jews there, one needs to make an eiruv chatzeiros . If there are non-Jews or nonobservant Jews there, one needs to rent from them. There are also two more issues that can cause one to violate the prohibition of carrying: Uninhabited or Nonresidential Areas If, within a walled or fenced-off complex, there is an uninhabited, unset- tled, or nonresidential area, 932 it renders the entire area a karmelis (semi-public area). 933 One is prohibited to carry inside that complex. 934 The size of this area is not particularly big — about__,186 square feet (one-third of an acre)/1,225 square meters. This prohibits carrying in the entire complex, even if there is an eiruvchatzeiros and one has rented or negotiated with the non-Jews or nonobservant Jews. An uninhabited area even renders an entire city-wide eiruv invalid. • If one goes to a completely fenced or walled-in resort or complex where there is an uninhabited area, lake, or marsh, overgrown grass, farming during growing season, vegetable garden in growing season, or anything similar, if the said area is more than__,186 square feet (one-third of an acre)/1,225 square meters, this will prohibit carrying even if one made an eiruv chatzeiros with the observant Jews and rented from or negotiated with the non-Jews and nonobservant Jews. The Solution In order to carry outside one’s unit in such a complex (in addition to an eiruv chatzeiros and renting from or negotiating with the non-Jews and nonobservant Jews), one would have to fence off the uninhabitable area. Al- ternatively, one can place a fence around his own property or space (with the management’s permission), and that will allow one to carry within the confines of that fence. These are basic guidelines. One should consult a Rav before building a solution to this issue. The other problem in resorts is that, even though they are walled off, they generally have an entrance or exit that is Halachically considered a break in the fence. We will discuss this shortly.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"932. Mishnah Berurah  358:72;  Biur Halachah  358:9, “ Aval ”;  Chazon Ish  8:25.

186,26/01/2026,VACATIONING ON SHABBOS:  ENTRANCES AND EXITS OF RESORTS  AND COMPLEXES,"We have discussed three potential issues with carrying in a resort, complex, or building. • If there are other observant Jews, an eiruv chatzeiros is needed. • If there are non-Jews or nonobservant Jews, their apartments must be rented or made available for use. • If there is__,186 square feet (one-third of an acre)/1,225 square meters of uninhabited land, it must be fenced off, or it will invalidate the eiruv in the entire complex. There is another issue with resorts, complexes, and buildings: the entrances and exits. Generally, a fully fenced-in complex would be considered a private domain (assuming the above three issues were solved). However, even if it is fenced-in on three sides, if the fourth side is open or breached, it changes into a karmelis (semi-public area) and carrying is prohibited in it___ and to or from it. 936 What Kind of Breach Is a Problem? If the gap in the wall is more than__ amos (15.75 feet/4.8 meters) wide, it renders the entire complex a karmelis . 937 If the gap is less than__.75 feet/4.8 meters wide but it is a path that the public walks through, it may also be considered a karmelis . 938 If the gap is less than__.75 feet/4.8 meters wide but the space that is not walled off is larger than the walled space, the area is still considered a karmelis . 939 The Solution The only way to solve this issue is to close up the breach. Either it needs a proper enclosure, or one can put up a Halachic wall, known as a tzuras hapesach . This is a vertical pole on both sides of the breach, and a horizontal beam or string connecting them above it. A city-wide eiruv is usually made with a tzuras hapesach in the form of two vertical poles with a horizontal bar above. Rules of a Tzuras HaPesach The poles on the side must be at least__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centi- meters) tall and strong enough to hold a mat or reed door. 940 The horizontal connector can be made of any material. Together, however, they must be able to withstand a normal wind. 941 The horizontal rope need not be touching the poles, but it must be exactly in line with them. It may not be attached to the sides of the vertical pole, because it must be on top of it. It must be in a straight line, and not be sagging. Note that if the resort or complex already has such a structure at the en- trance or exit (a wall or frame on both sides and a roof that connects them), it will be permitted to carry within the grounds once the other three issues have been dealt with. Doors or Gates That Close Some say that once there is a door or gate in the breach that closes at night, 942 the wall is Halachically considered closed up. 943 However, such a gate or door must fully close the gap in the wall. 944 Others are stringent, and rule that doors or gates do not serve to close the gap unless there is also a tzuras hapesach there. 945 • People who go to the Safari camps in the Kruger National Park need to solve the first three issues that we have discussed earlier (see the intro- duction to this section). There is always a fence around the camp, but there is an entrance wider than__.75 feet/4.8 meters. If there is a tzuras hapesach over it, this will serve to Halachically close off the gap. The gates are usually closed at night, and so, many Poskim consider it a wall for Halachic purposes. All this, however, must be verified beforehand. These are basic guidelines. One should consult a Rav before building a solution to these issues.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"935. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  363:1.
936. It is a dispute whether the prohibition is from the Torah or Rabbinic. See  Biur Halachah   363:1, “ Asru .”
937. Note that the Rambam holds that a  tzuras hapesach  is not valid if it is more than five meters  wide. The  Mishnah Berurah  362:59 states that it is correct to be stringent, and not rely on the  lenient opinion. This measurement is based on the ruling of Rav Chaim Na’eh. According to the  Chazon Ish, the width is 18.9 feet/5.76 meters.

187,27/01/2026,VACATIONS: A REVIEW OF  HOTZAAH ISSUES;  THE SEA;   GOING BEYOND THE CITY,"We have covered the four main issues of carrying that apply to a resort or complex in a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv . To review: • If there are other observant Jews, one needs an eiruv chatzeiros in order to carry in the shared areas inside. • If there are non-Jews or nonobservant Jews, their apartments or rooms must be rented or made available for use. • If there is__,186 square feet (one-third of an acre)/1,250 square me- ters of uninhabited land, it must be fenced off, or carrying in the entire complex will be prohibited. • If there is a breach or entrance that is more than__.75 feet/4.8 meters, it must have a tzuras hapesach , or the gates must be closed at night. The Sea and the Beach The sea, including the sand on a beach, falls into the category of karmelis (semi-public area) 946 — that is, it is not a private domain because it is not walled off, and it is not a public area of travel that fits into the Torah’s definition of a public domain. It follows that one may not carry an item from the city onto the beach or into the sea, nor may one carry an item on the seashore or in the sea. Leaving the City Limits Chazal prohibited going more than_,000 amos (0.6 miles/960 meters) beyond the last house of the city on Shabbos. This is called “going outside the techum (boundary).” This subject is beyond the scope of this work, but the basic rule is that it is forbidden to walk more than_.6 miles/960 meters past the last house of a city on Shabbos. This is not a halachah about carrying — it applies even to walking. • If one is on vacation in a complex that is not located in a city, he may not walk more than_.6 miles/960 meters outside the edge of the complex.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"946.

188,28/01/2026,LASH (KNEADING),"Introduction The process of making bread and creating dyes in the Mishkan involved kneading. Thus, kneading on Shabbos is a Torah prohibition. 947 Lash can be defined as mixing small solid particles with a liquid to form one mass or paste. Even if both are semi-dry and one joins them together to form one entity, it is forbidden. 948 • It is forbidden to make hummus because one mixes crushed chickpeas with liquid to form a paste. • It is forbidden to knead butter with cocoa powder. At times, merely pouring a liquid onto a fine powder is prohibited, and other times, only kneading it incurs the transgression. • It is forbidden to pour flour into water and knead it on Shabbos. 949 • One may not knead ground biscuits with smooth cheese. However, there may be leniencies for children, as we will see. 950 Included in the prohibition of lash are even things that do not grow from the ground. 951 • One may not mix oil with finely chopped hard-boiled eggs. 952 • One may not mix vinegar or water into finely chopped herring. Lash was also used in the Mishkan in the process of creating dye. Thus, lash also applies to non-food items. • One may not pour cement powder or sand into water on Shabbos. 953 Lash also applies to bodily fluids. 954 • One may not spit or urinate on loose sand. If one has no other option, he may do so on someone else’s property (with his permission).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,
189,29/01/2026,LASH: THICK AND THIN MIXTURES,"We have defined the melachah of lash (kneading) as mixing a solid and a liquid to form a new mass. At What Point Does the Prohibition Start? Pouring All authorities agree that merely pouring a liquid onto a powder or mashed solid is forbidden, though there is a debate regarding whether the prohibition is a Torah one or Rabbinic. 955 Stirring There is also no debate that stirring a liquid with a powder or pasty solid is prohibited. We will now elaborate on two different types of mixtures. Thick Mixtures Kneading is only a Torah prohibition when creating a thick mixture, which is not easily pourable from vessel to vessel. • Pouring or mixing water onto flour to make dough falls under the Torah prohibition of lash . 956 • Pouring or mixing water onto techinah powder to make thick techinah paste falls under the Torah prohibition of lash . 957 Thin Mixtures Kneading a thin mixture is a Rabbinic prohibition. A thin mixture is some- thing that is very easily pourable after it is mixed. 958 Note that the prohibition begins from the pouring stage. • Pouring water onto baby cereal to make a loose and pourable mixture falls under the Rabbinic prohibition. • Pouring milk onto matzah meal to make a loose and pourable mixture falls under the Rabbinic prohibition. 959 We will learn the permitted way to make certain foods that require mixing.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"955.

190,30/01/2026,LASH: THE LENIENCY OF A  DOUBLE SHINUI,"We have seen that making a thick mixture carries a Torah prohibition, whereas making a thin mixture carries a Rabbinic prohibition. We also saw that the prohibition begins from the pouring stage (and obviously includes actually mixing it). There is a unique leniency regarding lash : the double shinui (abnormal way of doing something). This leniency is only applicable in specific cases: • Thin mixtures___ such as loose and pourable baby cereal for a baby. Some Poskim say this should only be done if very necessary. 961 • Thick mixtures that would get spoiled if they were made before Shab- bos. 962 In these two special situations, one must adhere to the two conditions of the leniency, as follows. The Two Changes The order of pouring___ and the method of mixing___ must be done in a different way from how they are usually done. If it is normal to pour the liquid onto the solid, one must pour the solid onto the liquid. If it is normal to stir the mixture in order to combine it, one must stir the mixture differently. (If there is no normal way, one should ideally slowly pour the liquid into the solid. 965 ) • To make loose baby cereal, one must change the order of pouring. If he normally pours the liquid onto the cereal, he must pour the liquid first, and pour the powder into it. He must also change the manner of stirring. If he usually stirs with a spoon, on Shabbos he must stir using a crisscross motion (instead of a circular motion), or even better, with the back of a spoon or his finger. 966",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"960.

962. According to the  Mishnah Berurah , it is only permitted in a  bar givul  (a mixture in which the  solid and liquid become one dough). According to the Chazon Ish, it is even permitted in an  eino  bar givul  (a mixture in which the solid remains separate from the liquid).

191,31/01/2026,LASH: BREAKFAST,"We have seen four principles so far: • The melachah of lash (kneading) is defined as mixing a solid with a liquid. • Making a thick, non-pourable mixture constitutes the Torah prohi- bition, and making a thin, pourable mixture constitutes the Rabbinic prohibition. • If necessary, one is permitted to make a thin, pourable mixture if he reverses the pouring process and changes the way that it is mixed. • One is also permitted to make a thick mixture that would have spoiled if it was made before Shabbos if he reverses the pouring process and changes the way that it is mixed. To apply these principles practically, let us consider several applications of lash that may occur during breakfast. Thick Yogurt and Muesli or Bran Flakes Mixing thick yogurt with small, soft bran flakes or muesli that will combine to form a thick mixture constitutes a Torah prohibition. However, since doing so before Shabbos will probably ruin it, one is permitted to do so on Shabbos, provided that he makes a change in the method of mixing, such as stirring using a crisscross motion. If there is no normal way of doing it, he should put the yogurt onto the cereal. He should also reverse the order of pouring. 967 Milk and Porridge or Cereal Powder Mixing milk with porridge or oats (such as Quaker, ProNutro, or Weetabix) to form a mass is a Torah prohibition. Since it would spoil if prepared before Shabbos, one must change both the order of pouring and the method of mixing. Note that making hot porridge may constitute the melachah of bishul . Yogurt and Honey Mixing thick yogurt and honey will result in a thick mixture, which consti- tutes a Torah prohibition. One must change the method of mixing them, and the order of pouring them as well. 968 Cereal and Milk If adding a liquid to a solid will not combine them into one unit because it is so liquidy, there is no prohibition of lash . 969 Furthermore, if the solid merely dissolves into the liquid, such that the ul- timate result is a liquid, there is no prohibition of lash . Although pouring milk into cereal connects the two items, it does not create a combined solid. Thus, it is permitted without any changes. This is also true regarding all things that do not actually combine into one entity, such as putting kneidelach or croutons into soup. • It is not a problem of lash to combine breakfast cereals such as Corn Flakes, Kariyot, and Cheerios with milk. Coffee into Water or Milk If one item dissolves into another, it is not considered lash . Thus, one is permitted to put water into coffee powder as usual. 970 The same is true for baby formula powder that completely dissolves to form milk. NOTE: In both of the previous two examples, be sure to apply the halachos of bishul if the water or milk is hot (see Day__).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"967.

192,01/02/2026,LASH: ADDING TO A MIXTURE,"A Mixture from Before Shabbos If one mixed two things together very well before Shabbos, he may add liquid to it on Shabbos and mix it in gently. 971 However, he must not add other ingredients to it that would make it thicker. 972 • One may not make thick techinah on Shabbos. However, if he has already made it before Shabbos, and it is mixed well, he may add more liquid to it and mix it gently. 973 Furthermore, if the mixture was mixed well before Shabbos but started to separate a bit (such as often happens in oily mixtures), one may mix it back together gently on Shabbos. But he must not add other ingredients to it that would make it thicker. 974 • Oil is often found floating at the top of a new container of peanut butter. If the amount of oil is insignificant, one is permitted to mix it back into the peanut butter. If the amount of oil is significant, one can only do so with the double- shinui leniency. 975 Mixing Two of the Same One is permitted to mix two similar mixtures together. The prohibition of lash is mixing two different substances to form one mass. 976 • One may mix the contents of two containers of cottage cheese to- gether. • One may combine and mix two bowls of hummus or techinah together. A Naturally Occurring Mixture Mashed cooked fruit is a mixture of pulp and the original juice from the fruit. If they became separated, one is permitted to mix them together. Howev- er, one may not add another liquid to it___ (unless it was mixed that way from before Shabbos). • If one mashed cooked apples on Shabbos (in the permitted manner, as specified in Day___), and the mixture separated, he may mix it back together. However, he may not add water to it. Gravy on Rice or Potatoes One may pour gravy onto rice or mashed potatoes even though doing so will combine them into one mixture. However, one may only mix it in slowly. Doing so is not considered an act of kneading, but rather, a minor fine-tuning of the solid. 978",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"971.

193,02/02/2026,LASH: SALADS,"Mayonnaise and Other Liquids Before we discuss examples of salads, we must distinguish between pouring substances that are very liquidy, such as oil, vinegar, and lemon juice, and thicker substances like rich tomato sauce and mayonnaise. If a substance is liquidy, pouring it into a different substance mixes them immediately. However, when it is thicker, merely pouring it does not cause mix- ing immediately. Thus, regarding pouring, one can be more lenient with thicker substances like mayonnaise. However, regarding mixing, they are considered equally problematic, as mixing combines both kinds of substances. Having covered the principles of pouring and mixing, let us now apply them to salads. (Keep in mind that cutting vegetables into small pieces may constitute the Torah prohibition of tochen [grinding], and selecting different vegetables from a mixture may constitute the Torah prohibition of borer [selecting]. Please refer to those respective halachos for details.) French Salad or Fruit Salad These salads are permitted. The vegetables are cut quite large___ (not finely chopped). Pouring olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, or any thin salad dressings will not bind the mixture together. Therefore, if the pieces are still easily dis- cernible, 980 it is permitted. The same is true for pouring orange juice into a fruit salad, so long as the pieces of fruit are large and easily discernible. Carrot and Coleslaw Salad These salads present a problem. Mixing mayonnaise or even pouring vinegar into finely cut carrots or cabbage constitutes a Torah prohibition, as it would create a thick mixture. However, because preparing it before Shabbos would make it soggy and undesirable, one may mix it in a way that is different from usual (such as stirring with crisscross motions). One should also reverse the normal order of combining them. Eggplant Salad Mixing oil and vinegar into diced eggplant constitutes a Torah prohibition, as it creates a thick mixture. This could be prepared before Shabbos without spoiling. Therefore, one may not prepare it on Shabbos even if he changes the method. If one did prepare it before Shabbos, and the oil became somewhat separated from the eggplant, he is permitted to mix it back in gently. 981 Potato Salad Mixing mayonnaise into very small pieces of potato and onion constitutes a Torah prohibition, as it creates a thick mixture. Such a salad could be pre- pared before Shabbos without spoiling. Therefore, it is forbidden to make it on Shabbos. However, if the pieces of potato are not very small and are easily discernible, there is no prohibition, as it does not clump into one mass. Egg Salad and Tuna Salad In theory, mixing mayonnaise into ground eggs and onions___ or into tuna would create a thick mixture, and constitute a Torah prohibition. But due to two factors, the Poskim are lenient: a. There is room to debate whether preparing it before Shabbos would ruin it, allowing for a leniency on Shabbos, albeit using the double shinui . b. Tuna and eggs are edible before one adds anything else, and the re- sulting salad could be considered a mere fine-tuning of food (as we saw regarding gravy and rice). 983 Therefore, the custom is to be lenient, allowing them to be mixed together in an unusual manner and slowly. 984 But if one uses oil instead of mayonnaise, he must also reverse the order, pouring the tuna or egg into the oil.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"979.

194,03/02/2026,LASH: BABY FOOD;  JELL-O;   DIPPING COOKIES;  SPREADS,"Preparing Thick Baby Cereal Making thick baby cereal by mixing water with powder constitutes a Torah prohibition. However, since it is not something that can be prepared before Shabbos, one is permitted to do so by changing the method of mixing and the order of pouring. Preparing Thin Baby Cereal Making thin baby cereal by pouring and mixing water into powder consti- tutes a Rabbinic prohibition. One is required to make a double shinui , that is, pour the powder into the water and change the way of the mixing. Preparing Formula Mixing baby formula with water does not constitute lash at all. The powder gets completely absorbed and dissolved into the liquid, and does not create a solid mass. Similarly, one is permitted to pour cocoa mix into milk on Shabbos. 985 Jell-O One may not make Jell-O on Shabbos for two reasons: First, there is a pro- hibition of molid (creating). Second, although the powder dissolves into the water and forms a liquid initially, it ultimately becomes a solid mass. Therefore, Jell-O should be made before Shabbos. 986 Dipping Cookies It is permitted to dip cookies (into something cold or a kli shelishi , in order to avoid bishul ) on Shabbos, even though it may eventually become mush. This is because no kneading is taking place — one is merely softening the cookie. However, one must not go on to knead the wet cookie into a dough. 987 Spreads One is permitted to spread something on bread and then add a different spread on top of it, even though they may become one. It is not considered a mixture of a solid and a liquid. 988 • One may spread jelly on top of peanut butter, even though they may mix together and become one.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"985.

195,04/02/2026,LASH: IF ONE PERFORMED LASH,"The Torah Prohibition: A Thick, Non-Pourable Mixture Intentional The mixture is prohibited to the person who mixed it. Other people may only use or eat it after Shabbos has ended, but not on that Shabbos, 989 even if he did not mix it for them. 990 Unintentional If one unintentionally or unknowingly transgressed the Torah prohibition of lash , he and others are forbidden to benefit from it for the duration of Shabbos. 991 In a case of need, it may be permitted to others and even to the sinner himself, and a Rav should be consulted. 992 Note that although the mixing is definitely a Torah prohibition to which the above rules apply, the pouring stage is the subject of dispute regarding its status. If one merely poured, the food will still be permitted. • If one poured water into flour to make a thick mixture, the food is still permitted. However, if one intentionally mixed it into a thick mixture, it is forbidden to him and others until after Shabbos. If one mixed it unintentionally, it is also forbidden to him and others until after Shab- bos. In a case of need, it may be permitted to others and even the sinner himself, and a Rav should be consulted. 993 The Rabbinic Prohibition: A Thin, Pourable Mixture Note that the transgression referred to here applies to either pouring or mixing (or both). Intentional If one intentionally and knowingly transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition, no one may benefit from the food on Shabbos. 994 After Shabbos, anyone is permitted to benefit from it. 995 Unintentional If one unintentionally or unknowingly transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition, it is forbidden for him to benefit from it for the duration of Shabbos. Others may benefit from it. 996 In a case of need, it may be permitted to him as well, and a Rav should be consulted. 997 • If one intentionally and knowingly poured or mixed water into baby cereal to make a thin, pourable mixture, it is forbidden on Shabbos. After Shabbos, it is permitted to all. If one did so unintentionally or unknowingly, it is permitted to others (including the child) immediately, and it is forbidden to him until after Shabbos, except in a case of great need (a Rav should be consulted). In any such situation, one should consult a Rav , as there are other circum- stances that may allow for leniencies after the mistake has occurred. 998",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"989.

196,05/02/2026,MELABEN (WHITENING),"Introduction One of the acts done during the building and service of the Mishkan was the cleaning of materials. This is known as melaben (whitening). 999 (As we mentioned previously, we are not following the order that the mela- chos took place in the Mishkan.) What Constitutes Melaben? Anything that is part of the laundering process is forbidden. Examples in- clude soaking, pouring, wringing out, rubbing with brushes or against another item, squeezing, 1000 drying with heat, 1001 drying in sunlight, 1002 and at times, even folding materials. We will distinguish between these as we go into more detail. Which Materials Are Subject to This Prohibition? All garments and clothes that can be and usually are cleaned are subject to melaben . 1003 Leather is also subject to the prohibition, except that with regard to linen and clothing, merely pouring water on them or soaking them is forbidden, whereas in the case of leather, one only transgresses melaben if he rubs the item in order to clean it. It is also forbidden to soak leather in water. 1004 • If one pours water or soap onto a shirt that was splashed with gravy in order to clean it, he transgresses the Torah prohibition. • Pouring water onto a leather shoe that was splashed with gravy is permit- ted. However, one may not scratch, brush, or heavily rub off the gravy, and one who does so transgresses the Torah prohibition. 1005 The prohibition applies to both white and colored materials. Any cleans- ing agent is included in the prohibition, even if it is not wet, such as washing powder. 1006",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"999. Shabbos  73b.

197,06/02/2026,MELABEN: MATERIALS THAT  MAY BE WASHED,"We have seen that anything that is normally part of the laundering process is prohibited on Shabbos. We also saw that with regard to garments, merely adding water is prohibited, whereas in the case of leather, pouring alone is not prohibited, and one only transgresses the Torah prohibition of melaben once he scrubs the leather in some way. Materials That Are Not Subject to Melaben Anything that is hard or not very absorbent is different from the materials that were cleaned in the process in the Mishkan, and one may wash these. 1007 Examples include glass, metal, hard plastic, and wood. • One may wash ceramic dishes if they are needed during Shabbos. 1008 Paper Paper is not something that is usually cleaned. Therefore, according to most Poskim , it is not subject to the prohibition of melaben . 1009 • If gravy spills onto a bentsher , one may wipe it off. Skin The body is not included in the prohibition. 1010 • If one’s hand gets dirty, he may clean it with water. Soft or Flexible Plastic Interestingly, most Poskim question whether washing soft or flexible plastic is permitted. Therefore, one should avoid vigorously rubbing such material. 1011 • If gravy spills onto the plastic covering of the dining room chairs, one should not rub them vigorously. However, one may wipe them lightly. • If a pacifier falls onto the floor, one may rinse it under water, but he should not rub it vigorously. 1012 Note that if the stitching of these items is made from cotton or similar ab- sorbent material, one must not put that section of the item under water. 1013",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1007.

198,07/02/2026,MELABEN: WHEN POURING  OR SOAKING WILL NOT MAKE  THE ITEM CLEANER,"We have seen that pouring water or soap onto an absorbent material is for- bidden. We will now discuss the halachah pertaining to something that will not be affected at all from soaking in water or soap. When Water Will Not Clean When a material will become dirtier by using it to dry or wipe oneself, there is no prohibition of melaben . 1014 It is, however, good to first shake the excess water off one’s hands before drying them. 1015 One must not squeeze the liquid out from the material, and one must cer- tainly hold it only from the dry section. If a towel starts to get saturated, one should use a different towel, as using it is likely to squeeze out liquid, which is forbidden. 1016 • One may wipe his face with a dry towel even though it will cause the towel to become wet. 1017 However, he may not squeeze it out, and he must only hold it on the dry or slightly damp portion of the towel. • One may walk in the rain even though his garments may end up getting soaked because they probably will not end up cleaner, and this is not his intention in any case. However, he may not squeeze them out, and he may only hold them by the dry portions when he removes them (and if there are no dry or slightly damp portions, he should let them slip off). Two limitations of This Leniency Must Not Intend to Clean This leniency only applies if one does not intend to clean the garment. 1018 • In the above cases, if the towel is already dirty and getting it wet will clean it somewhat, it is forbidden. Similarly, one is prohibited to go out into the rain in order to clean a dirty garment (even partially). Must Use A Towel That Is Worthless as Clothing If it is a large spill or liquid that is being absorbed, one may only use a rag or discarded towel to clean it. 1019 One may not use anything that he values sig- nificantly, as Chazal were concerned that one who significantly values such a garment or towel that is wet with unwanted liquid will come to squeeze it, which constitutes a Torah prohibition. 1020 • One may not place a special towel on a large spill of gravy on the tiled floor. Instead, he must use a rag or discarded towel. He may only pick it up by the section that is still dry, and may not squeeze it out.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1014.

199,08/02/2026,MELABEN: SCRAPING DIRT AWAY;   CLEANING WITHOUT USING A LIQUID,"We have seen that using a liquid to clean a garment by pouring water on it or soaking it in water is prohibited, regardless of how well or poorly it cleans. Furthermore, using any cleansing agent is prohibited, even if it is dry, like wash- ing powder. What is the halachah regarding cleaning without using any liquid or cleansing agent, such as scraping off dirt? Wet Dirt The halachah is that only applying liquid is considered washing. 1021 Howev- er, removing a piece of dirt without liquid still appears to be like washing, and is Rabbinically prohibited according to most opinions. 1022 Therefore, it is only permitted if the stain will not be completely removed, and only if it is removed in an inefficient manner. There are two options: 1023_. Rubbing the dirty parts together by holding the inside of the gar- ments, and from there, rubbing the stain against itself, so that it will (hopefully) fall off on the outside. 1024_. Using a fingernail, the sharp end of a knife, or a dry tissue to scrape it off on the outside. • If cholent falls on one’s white Shabbos shirt, pouring liquid or soak- ing it would constitute a Torah prohibition. One may grasp the shirt from the inside and try to rub it. Alternatively, he may scrape it off using a fingernail, the edge of a knife, or a napkin. This is because the stain will still be visible after doing so, and such a method is not an efficient way of cleaning. One may not take the outside of the garment and rub one side against the other, as this is a classic way of cleaning garments, as we have seen previously. 1025 Dried Dirt If the stain is dry, the same rules apply, except that it is prohibited if it in- volves tochen____ (see Day___ that grinding items that are reconstituted from previously ground materials is permitted). • If some mud dried onto one’s Shabbos shirt, scraping or rubbing it would constitute the prohibition of tochen (grinding). Therefore, he may not scrape it. However, he may hint to a non-Jew to remove it if he feels embarrassed because of it. 1027 • On the other hand, if some cholent dried up on one’s Shabbos shirt, he may scrape or rub it from the inside, or use a fingernail or knife on the outside. Talc or Salt on Stains It is prohibited to clean stains using talc or salt because this is a normal way to draw out a stain, and is prohibited even if the stain will still be somewhat visible. 1028",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1021. Mishnah Berurah  302:33.
1022. However, Rashi holds that in certain situations it can be forbidden from the Torah to clean  stains even without water. See  Shaar HaTzion  302:41.

200,09/02/2026,"MELABEN: DUST, FEATHERS,  SNOW, AND DEW","We have seen that one may only clean a garment (even without using liquid) if it would not become completely clean and it is not a normal way to clean. This is the case when the dirt is absorbed into the garment. We will now discuss two scenarios regarding shaking out dirt. Resting or Floating on Top of the Garment If something is merely resting on top of a garment, one is permitted to shake it off — but he must not use a brush. 1029 • One may shake off feathers, crumbs, or dust that has not been absorbed within the garment, or a light accumulation of snow from his cloth- ing. 1030 • If a lone, unattached cotton thread happens to be on one’s suit, he may pluck it off. 1031 Stuck in the Garment If something is stuck in the garment, such as dust or chalk, the halachah depends on how particular one is that it be clean. The general rules are: 1032_. If one cares that the garment is dirty, it is forbidden to clean it. 2. If one does not care if the garment is dirty, it is permitted to remove it. 3. If the garment is black or dark colored and it is new, the halachah assumes that the wearer is particular about it. • If dust falls onto one’s pajamas, shaking it off is permitted, assuming one does not care. But if dust falls onto one’s new, black pajamas, it is forbidden to shake it off, as the halachah assumes that one is particular about it. 1033 • If chalk falls onto one’s Shabbos suit, shaking it off is forbidden, as one probably does care. NOTE: If one only wishes to shake out the garment so that it will be clean in honor of Shabbos (not because he cares about the garment), he may shake it out. 1034 Avoiding Dusty Areas It is worthwhile to keep garments only in places where there is little dust, in order to avoid inadvertently transgressing melaben . 1035 Brushes and Cleaning Utensils Even in the above cases where cleaning is permitted, a brush or a cleaning utensil may never be used. 1036 But shaking or wiping with a dry cloth is permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1029.

201,10/02/2026,MELABEN: PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS,"Having discussed the rules of cleaning surfaces on Shabbos, here are some of the practical applications. Dusting One may dust a wooden shelf using a dry cloth on Shabbos, as the surface is hard. One may not use a cleaning implement such as a brush, nor may one use a cloth that has some value. Eyeglasses and Contact Lenses One may wipe his glasses with a dry cloth. One may soak his hard or soft contact lenses in pure saline on Shabbos, but he should not rub them vigor- ously. 1037 Some Poskim forbid putting soft contact lenses in a liquid that has a cleaning agent inside. 1038 Note that if the lenses have dried out, and one wants to revitalize them by soaking them in liquid, it is forbidden. One may soak hard lenses in any liquid. 1039 Leather Shoes One may not clean dried dirt that is on his shoe, as it constitutes the prohi- bition of tochen (grinding). If the dirt is still wet, he may pour water onto it, but he may not rub the dirt off. Shoes Made of Fabric If the shoes have fabric inside (even the stitching or lining), one may not pour anything onto them, nor may he rub them when water has been put on them, or with wet hands. He may pinch the material from the inside and rub. Alternatively, he may scrape them gently with his nail, the edge of a knife, or a dry cloth. Shaking Out or Drying a Coat One may not shake out a wet coat made of fabric. Doing so will undoubt- edly cause squeezing, and thus clean the garment, which is forbidden. One may also not put it near a heater or oven, as this constitutes a prohibition of bishul (cooking) even if he would remove it before it reaches___°F/43°C. Soaking Up a Spill on the Floor One may place a discarded or otherwise insignificant towel on a spill on the floor in order to absorb it. Afterwards, he may only remove the towel by grasping a part that is still dry. He may not squeeze it, and he should hold it very gently in order to avoid squeezing it by mistake. 1040 If the spill is very small, one may even use a good or significant towel, as above. It is best to use precut paper towels or tissues that will be thrown away immediately to soak up a spill. 1041 Walking in the Rain One may walk in the rain even though his clothing may get wet, but he may not do so with the intention to clean a dirty garment.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1037.

202,11/02/2026,MELABEN: FOLDING AND  HANGING CLOTHES,"Folding Clothing Folding clothing on the creases is part of the laundering process, and actually makes the clothing last longer. 1042 One may not fold clothes on their original creases on Shabbos. 1043 It is praiseworthy not to fold clothes at all, even not on the creases. 1044 • One may not fold his tallis on the lines. He may fold them near the lines instead. 1045 It is praiseworthy not to fold it at all until after Shabbos. Hanging Clothes One may not hang clothes as part of a laundry process, such as on a washing line or on a hanger. One may hang clothes over a chair or on a hook to store it neatly, in a way that the creases adjust by themselves. 1046 However, he should not specifically align the garment across its creases or put it on a hanger to fix or create the creases. No Lines or Creases If there are no creases or lines, one may fold a garment as he wishes. 1047 • One may fold pajamas or undershirts as he wishes if they do not have any lines or folds. • One may fold socks. • One may fold a tallis that has lost all its original lines, but he should not intend to make new ones. 1048 Shoe Holder One can insert a wooden shoe holder into a shoe to maintain its shape. Similarly, one may place the shoe on a shoe holder. However, one’s intention must not be to straighten out any creases. 1049 Folding Napkins Folding a napkin in a normal way, in order that it will be neat, is permitted. But one may not fold a napkin into a particular shape, as it is considered like tikkun moneh (fixing an object), which is forbidden on Shabbos. 1050 Folding Paper One may fold paper as he wishes, because one only does so in order to pre- vent it from becoming torn or dirty, not to improve the actual paper. 1051 However, one may not build shapes with paper (origami). Straightening Hats If one’s hat has been bent out of shape, he may straighten it. 1052 Ironing Needless to say, it is prohibited to iron clothes on Shabbos (even if one uses a nonelectric iron or an iron that is off). 1053 One may also not do anything to flatten clothing and create creases. • One may not put his pants under a mattress in order to straighten them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1042.

Squeezing Out a Liquid — Extracting It is worthwhile to mention that squeezing out one thing from another is also prohibited under the melachah of dash (extracting), 1056 such as squeezing juice from fruit. This is known as sechitah (squeezing). Thus, whether the garment becomes cleaner or not is irrelevant — extracting one thing from its source is forbidden. (See Day___.) • One may not squeeze out juice that was absorbed in a wet towel or garment, even though it still will not be clean thereafter, because it con- stitutes a prohibition of dash . Squeezing out water from a fabric is always forbidden, because it cleans it. In a case where the liquid that comes out is unwanted or dirty, it is still forbidden because it is considered extracting. In certain circumstances, though, it may be permitted — one should consult a Rav . 1057 Sponges A sponge absorbs liquid easily and releases it with a slight application of pressure. Therefore, one may not use a sponge on Shabbos. 1058 One should not even use a dry sponge to clean wet cutlery. 1059 Mops A mop absorbs water, and is essentially a towel for the floor. As one pushes the mop across the floor, it squeezes out some of the water inside it. Thus, it is prohibited to use a mop on Shabbos. 1060 (It is also forbidden due to the Rabbinic prohibition of evening out the floor, which we will discuss in Day___.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1054.

204,13/02/2026,MELABEN: DRYING DISHES;   COTTON WOOL,"Drying Dishes with a Towel One may use a dry towel to wipe cutlery and dishes. However, if it starts to get saturated, he must switch to another towel. 1061 One should not dry a very thin or narrow item. This is because it is likely that in doing so he will squeeze out some of the liquid as he presses the towel into the crevice. 1062 Also, as mentioned previously, one may not use a towel that he values sig- nificantly to absorb a large spill. This is a Rabbinic prohibition, lest one come to squeeze out the liquid from it because it is important to him. 1063 • One may dry the dishes that he needs for Shabbos using a dry towel. • One should not dry a very narrow cup. • One may use an insignificant rag to soak up a large spill, but he must be careful not to squeeze or apply pressure to it. He may only hold it by a dry portion of it. Cotton Wool The use of wet cotton wool constitutes a problem of squeezing. As one applies pressure to it, it will undoubtedly cause some liquid to emerge, which is forbidden. 1064 • If one needs to clean a wound or apply antiseptic medicine to it (pre- ventative medicine is permitted on Shabbos, as discussed in Day___), he may not dip cotton wool into liquid or soak it in liquid. Even if it was already prepared before Shabbos, he may not dab it. Rather, he must put the water or antiseptic directly on the wound, and slowly wipe it with a dry piece of thick cotton wool, being very careful not to apply any pressure. 1065",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1061.

205,14/02/2026,MELABEN: BABY WIPES AND  PAPER TOWELS,"We have seen that squeezing liquid out of a cloth is prohibited because of melaben (whitening) and dash (extracting). Here are further applications of the halachos of squeezing on Shabbos. Baby Wipes Baby wipes are practical because they are already wet. However, they are forbidden to be used on Shabbos, because as one rubs them on the child, some of that liquid will undoubtedly come out (the prohibition of dash ). 1066 Even if one partially dries them out before Shabbos, there is no guarantee that extracting will not take place, and thus it is still prohibited. 1067 • One may not use baby wipes at all on Shabbos. Napkins and Paper Towels Although napkins and paper towels are not subject to the prohibition of melaben (as they are thrown away soon after use), 1068 squeezing out liquid from them could still be a problem of dash . Thus, one should only use them to dry minor spills, and be sure not to apply pressure when wiping with them. One may place them on a spill to absorb it. Note that paper towels must be cut before Shabbos. Baby-Bottle Brushes One may use a baby-bottle brush if the synthetic teeth are far apart from each other. 1069",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1066. Orchos Shabbos  13:46.

206,15/02/2026,MELABEN: SQUEEZING HAIR,"As we have explained, squeezing out a liquid is prohibited both because of melaben (whitening) and dash (extracting). Wet Hair It is Rabbinically prohibited____ to squeeze liquid from one’s hair. 1071 Although moving a drenched cloth is prohibited, lest one squeeze liquid from it, 1072 lightly touching one’s wet hair is permitted. 1073 Putting Clothes on Over Wet Hair One should avoid putting on clothes that will undoubtedly squeeze water from wet hair. 1074 Going to the Mikvah on Shabbos One who goes to the mikvah on Shabbos should be careful not to squeeze his hair afterwards. • A man who has become impure and goes to the mikvah must be careful not to squeeze his hair afterwards. 1075 Face and Beard One may wash his face and beard on Shabbos. 1076 However, one must be certain not to squeeze the water out of his hair afterwards. 1077 Furthermore, if just a few hairs get wet, he may dry them normally, as the prohibition of squeezing only applies where there is an accumulation of hairs. 1078 Body Hair As we have said, the prohibition of squeezing out water from hair only ap- plies where there is an accumulation of hair. Small patches of hair on one’s arm or leg are not subject to the prohibition. 1079 Drying One’s Hair Although squeezing one’s hair is forbidden, one may place a towel on his hair to absorb the moisture. One may not rub it down forcefully, but he may dry it gently, 1080 being careful not to squeeze.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1070. Maggid Mishneh  9:11;  Beis Yosef ,  Yoreh Dei’ah  199.

207,16/02/2026,KOSHER AND MATIR  (TYING AND UNTYING),"Introduction Another two melachos that were performed in the Mishkan were tying and untying knots. 1081 Therefore, tying and untying knots on Shabbos is forbidden. The Relationship between Tying and Untying Any knot that one is forbidden to tie because it is considered a real knot, one is also forbidden to untie. 1082 Thus, in all of the cases below where we pro- hibit tying because it is a Torah prohibition, untying the knot also constitutes a Torah prohibition. A Torah-Prohibited Knot____ There are differing opinions as to what constitutes a Torah-prohibited knot. We rule that a knot is prohibited if it was made to last a long time or if it is a professional knot. Furthermore, any knot that is likely to remain indefinitely is considered a professional knot, 1084 and constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1085 • Tying tefillin and tightening the knots of one’s tzitzis constitute the Torah prohibition. 1086 • Tying a professional knot that people make to secure their boats or animals constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1087 • Tying a knot to fix or establish an eiruv that is intended to last indef- initely constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1088 (See footnote regarding asking a non-Jew to do so.) • Tying one’s lulav together with the other minnim (for those who bind it instead of using a holder) on Yom Tov constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Tying the knot at the end of a balloon, which is likely to last until the end of its lifetime, constitutes the Torah prohibition. Note that the duration that the knot will remain tied is based on what people usually do, not what one’s intentions are at the time that he tied the knot. 1089 • Even if one plans to untie the knot of his balloon within the day, it is prohibited, as most people leave a balloon tied indefinitely. Temporary Knots A knot that people usually untie within twenty-four hours and is not a pro- fessional knot is permitted (even if it ends up being tied for more than twen- ty-four hours). 1090 • It is permitted to tie a bow on the shoes of a child, as it is not profession- al, and it is generally untied before the child goes to sleep.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1081.

208,17/02/2026,KOSHER AND MATIR:  KNOTS THAT CONSTITUTE THE  TORAH PROHIBITION,"A KNOT THAT WILL REMAIN INDEFINITELY We saw that a knot that generally remains indefinitely constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1091 Here are a few more examples. • Making a knot in a single thin string constitutes the Torah prohibition, as it is likely to remain indefinitely. 1092 • Tying together a ripped curtain pull-cord in order to repair it constitutes the Torah prohibition, as the knot is likely to remain indefinitely. • Tying a knot from two broken ends of shoelaces constitutes the Torah prohibition, as it is likely to remain indefinitely. • Tying a knot in a garbage bag may constitute a Torah prohibition, as it is not likely to ever be untied. • Threading a rope through the handle of jump ropes and tying a knot on the outside constitutes the Torah prohibition. A Professional Knot Another form of a Torah-prohibited knot is a knot that is professional. 1093 This is because professional knots will not come undone. 1094 • Tying string to a needle constitutes the Torah prohibition as it is a pro- fessional sewing knot. • A surgeon’s knot, fisherman’s bend knot, cat’s-paw, and loop knot are all considered professional knots, and constitute the Torah prohibition. • As we have seen earlier, the knots of tzitzis and tefillin are professional knots, and constitute the Torah prohibition.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1091.

209,18/02/2026,KOSHER AND MATIR: DOUBLE KNOTS,"We have seen that there are two types of Torah-prohibited knots: those that will last indefinitely and those that are professional or sophisticated. What is the status of a knot on a knot? Two Knots on Top of Each Other Two knots on top of each other are very durable and usable, even though they are not professional. Therefore, one should be stringent not to tie or untie such a knot____ because it may be Halachically considered a professional knot, which constitutes a Torah prohibition. 1096 This is forbidden even if the first knot was made before Shabbos. 1097 • One should not tie the ends of a plastic bag with a double knot. How- ever, one may tie a very loose single knot. 1098 • One should not tie a double knot on a bib, even though it will be undone after the meal. • One should not tie the strings of a baby’s hat with a double knot. In cases where there is a mitzvah or a great need, tying or untying a double knot is permitted. 1099 • If there was a double knot on a Sefer Torah , one may untie it in order to read from the Torah. • If a child (who is not in danger) needs medicine that is in a packet that has been double knotted, one may untie it. • If a shoelace is too tight and it is causing genuine discomfort, one may untie it. A Summary So Far • A knot that will last indefinitely constitutes the Torah prohibition. • A knot that is professional constitutes the Torah prohibition. • A double knot should be avoided unless it is very loose or for a mitzvah or a case of great need.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1095.

210,19/02/2026,KOSHER AND MATIR:  RABBINICALLY PROHIBITED KNOTS,"We have defined Torah-prohibited knots as those that last indefinitely, or are professional. Most other knots are prohibited Rabbinically. Rabbinically Prohibited Knots A Knot That Will Last for More Than Twenty-Four Hours Chazal prohibited tying any knot that will exist for more than twenty-four hours, 1100 even though it will not remain indefinitely. However, in cases of great need or for a mitzvah, one can be lenient if it will remain for under one week. 1101 • When tying closed the Sefer Torah on Shabbos at Minchah , one should avoid making a knot, 1102 as it will exist until Monday (more than twen- ty-four hours), when the Torah will next be read. Instead, one can use Velcro or a clip. However, if these are not available, one may be lenient and tie a knot and a bow, because it will remain for under one week. 1103 Tying a knot on Shabbos morning is permitted if that Sefer Torah will be used by Minchah that day, and if it is not very tight. A Tight Knot____ In addition, Chazal prohibited tying any knot extremely tightly, even if it is temporary. 1105 This even includes a single knot. 1106 • One may not tie a tight knot around a box of food, even if he intends to undo it within twenty-four hours. • One may not seal a plastic bag with a tight knot, even if it is just one tie. A Summary So Far • Knots that will last indefinitely or are professional constitute the Torah prohibition. • Knots that will last more than twenty-four hours (or under a week in certain situations) or are extremely tight are prohibited Rabbinically. • A double knot should be avoided, unless it is for a mitzvah or in a cir- cumstance of great difficulty, or if it is very loose.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1100.

211,20/02/2026,KOSHER AND MATIR:  PERMITTED KNOTS,"We have seen that all professional knots, knots that will last indefinitely, knots that will last more than twenty-four hours (or more than a week in certain circumstances), and knots that are tight are forbidden. We will now discuss knots that may be tied or untied on Shabbos. Permitted Knots Any loose knot that is not professional and will not last more than twen- ty-four hours is permitted. 1107 This includes bows made on knots. • One may tie a Sefer Torah at Shacharis on Shabbos using a bow on a knot, assuming that it will be read by Minchah . • A woman may tie her tichel using a loose double knot, because it is not tight, and she usually unties it within twenty-four hours. However, if she usually leaves it tied, it is forbidden. • One may tie shoelaces using a bow on a knot____ if he usually unties the laces each night. If one keeps his shoelaces tied, he may not tie shoelaces on Shabbos. Making a second bow on top of the first bow is forbidden regardless. • One may tie a weak knot over her dress if it will be untied within twen- ty-four hours (and not stored that way). • One may tie a loose knot on the gartel that is around his waist. 1109 • One may tie a bandage on himself using a loose knot if it will be untied within twenty-four hours. See below. How to Judge Whether a Knot Will Be Untied Within Twenty-Four Hours If people always leave this kind of knot for more than twenty-four hours, one’s own intention is irrelevant. However, if some do and some do not, one’s own intention is the deciding factor. • Balloons are almost always tied with a tight single knot that will last indefinitely. Therefore, it is prohibited to tie a knot on a balloon even if one plans to untie it within twenty-four hours. • Bandages may or may not be kept on for twenty-four hours. Therefore, the permissibility of tying a bandage depends on one’s own intentions. However, some wounds may need to remain covered for more than twenty-four hours. If so, tying a knot on a bandage over such a wound may be prohibited even if one intends to remove it within twenty-four hours. If it is necessary, one should consult a Rav , as there may be other factors that permit it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1107. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  317:1.

212,21/02/2026,"KOSHER AND MATIR: NECKTIES,  SLIPKNOTS, AND SHOELACES","We have seen that one is permitted to tie or untie knots if all of these con- ditions are met: • The knot is not professional. • The knot is a kind of knot that does not stay tied for more than twen- ty-four hours (or seven days under certain circumstances). • The knot is not tight. All other knots are forbidden. Other Permitted Knots Slipknot ( Anivah ) A slipknot is not considered a real knot, as it is made to be easily undone, and may be made even if it will last longer than twenty-four hours. 1110 Neckties A necktie is not considered a knot, as the end is merely inserted into a loose knot, and if one pulls it, it will come undone. One may also make a double necktie knot. 1111 Shoelaces: A Bow on a Knot ( Anivah al gabei Kesher ) The twining of two laces is not considered a knot. However, if one ties a bow on top of that, it does become a firm and lasting knot. One may only do so if it will be untied within twenty-four hours, unless there is a great need or it is for a mitzvah. However, one may tie a double bow that does not have a knot below it. 1112 Tucking Ends into a Wound-Up String One may take a string and wrap it around an object, and tuck the ends of the string into itself. 1113 • If one forgot to tie up his lulav before Yom Tov, he can wrap a piece of palm around the lulav, hadassim , and aravos , and then tuck the ends of the piece into itself. Twist Ties According to some Poskim , using twist ties (whether plastic or metal) is a type of tying. 1114 Therefore, it is advisable to avoid using them unless it is very necessary.

213,22/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER  (BUILDING AND DISASSEMBLING),"Introduction One of the creative acts in the Mishkan was the building and disassembling of it. Therefore, building ( boneh ) and disassembling ( soser ) a structure on Shab- bos are prohibited. Wherever building is prohibited, dismantling the same thing in order to use that space is also a Torah prohibition. The Torah Prohibition The basic prohibition is erecting a fixed structure on land or adding to such a structure. 1115 Similarly, removing from such a structure is forbidden. Preparing land for building is also forbidden. 1116 Practical Applications • Building a wall or part of it on Shabbos constitutes the Torah prohibi- tion. Removing a wall or part of it on Shabbos in order to build in that space constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Digging a hole on Shabbos in order to build a foundation inside it con- stitutes the Torah prohibition. • Plastering up a hole in a wall constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Replacing a door on its hinges or a sliding door on its track constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Hammering a nail into a wall in order to hang something on it consti- tutes the Torah prohibition. 1117 • Removing or replacing a shelf on a bookcase that is attached to the wall constitutes the Torah prohibition. Note that many of the tools and items that apply to the melachos of boneh and soser are muktzeh , and therefore may not be moved.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1115. Shabbos  102b.

214,23/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  MORE PRACTICAL EXAMPLES,"We have seen that building or disassembling a permanent fixture or struc- ture constitutes a Torah prohibition. 1118 This is irrespective of the size of the addition or removal. More Practical Examples Clearing a Gutter, Drain, or Sink Removing leaves from a blocked gutter is considered fixing a fixed building, and is prohibited. 1119 However, it may be permitted with a shinui in limited cases. One should consult a Rav . 1120 Installing or Removing a Light Bulb Putting a light bulb into its electric socket constitutes the Torah prohibition of boneh . (If the power is on, other prohibitions also apply. 1121 ) Removing a light bulb from an electric socket constitutes the Torah prohi- bition of soser (even if the power is not on). Adding or Removing a Filter Some people have filters on their faucets so that all water is automatically filtered before it exits. According to some Poskim , this is not a problem of borer even though the undesirable dirt is separated from water as it passes through — but only if the person drinking that water is not particular to always drink such filtered water (See Day___). Either way, attaching such a filter permanently to the faucet or removing it from the faucet constitutes a Torah prohibition. One may, however, attach it loosely in a way that is very temporary and will not remain as a permanent fitting. 1122 Putting in or Removing a Drawer Placing a drawer onto its track or completely removing such a drawer con- stitutes the Torah prohibition, if such a drawer has a brake that prevents it from coming out during normal usage. 1123 Pulling or pushing such a drawer on its track is permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1118.

The prohibition applies even to adjustments made on the ground itself, 1125 not just on walls and structures. Practical Applications • Arranging bricks or pebbles to border a lawn or garden constitutes boneh , as a permanent fixture is being placed on the ground. 1126 Moving such items is also prohibited because they are muktzeh . • Replacing bricks or tiles to form a path (landscaping) constitutes boneh . • Leveling the ground in order to walk on it constitutes boneh . Stamping one’s feet to flatten or solidify the ground may also be considered boneh . As we have mentioned, boneh is prohibited with the slightest of actions. • Merely placing a brick as part of a useful structure is considered boneh . • Sticking the wire of a fence into the ground constitutes boneh . Dismantling in the Above Cases It bears repeating that the melachah of boneh directly correlates with the melachah of soser . In any of the above cases, removal from the ground in order to use that space for building constitutes soser . • Removing bricks, sand, or wires in order to build in the cleared space constitutes the Torah prohibition of soser .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1124.

216,25/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  LARGE MOVABLE ITEMS;   ADDING OR REMOVING FROM  A PERMANENT STRUCTURE,"Until now, we have discussed boneh and soser regarding a permanent struc- tural change to land or buildings. Some portable objects are so big that they are considered fixed structures as relates to boneh and soser . 1128 Adding or removing a permanent fixture____ from such an object is prohibited under these melachos . 1130 A vessel is consid- ered large enough to apply if it can hold more than___ gallons/680 liters, or an average person. Practical Examples • Adding a shelf to a big bookcase or removing it constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1131 • Making or puncturing a large wine barrel constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Pushing a loose hubcap onto a car constitutes boneh . Removing it con- stitutes soser . 1132 • Removing or replacing a shelf in a refrigerator constitutes the Torah prohibition if it is not made to take in and out regularly. Adding or Removing____ We have discussed that the Torah prohibition of boneh involves making a structural change to land, buildings, or large objects. Adding onto or removing from a permanent structure is also forbidden. 1134 Practical Examples • If a mezuzah cover fell off, one may not replace it on Shabbos, even though he is merely adding to the wall. It can and should, however, be picked up with a shinui (see Day___). • If an eiruv wall, pole, or string broke, one may not place an object there as a replacement. In certain circumstances, one may ask a non-Jew to fix it. 1135 A Rav should be consulted. • If a window fell out of its frame, one may not install a sheet or plank to cover it. Doing so constitutes boneh . 1136 However, one may cover it by letting the sheet or plank rest on the frame, without fully in- stalling it in. • If a window shattered, one may not remove the shards from it, as doing so constitutes soser . However, if it is dangerous to leave them in, he may ask a non-Jew to remove it, or remove it himself with a shinui . 1137 • If a door is creaky, one may not pour oil onto its hinges. 1138",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1127.

217,26/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  A SUKKAH SUMMARY,"We will now review the halachos that we have discussed so far, using a suk- kah as an example. • The basic prohibition is to erect or dismantle a fixed structure. • One may not build a sukkah on Shabbos or Yom Tov. One may also not sit in a sukkah that a Jew built on Shabbos or Yom Tov. 1139 • The prohibition also applies to adding permanent fixtures to the ground. • One may not lay down bricks or tiles to create a path to the sukkah. • One may not replace the cover of an outdoor drain. • Building or dismantling large movable items is also prohibited. • One may not build or repair a table or chair. • Adding to or removing from an existing structure is also forbidden. • One may not add schach to a sukkah. However, he may ask a non-Jew to put schach on if it fell off. 1140 • One may not attach lights or decorations to a sukkah. • Even if the structure is already up, one may not tie boards or canvas to the sides of a sukkah. • One may not secure a loose support beam. • One may not unblock a drain. However, this may be permitted in certain circumstances with a shinui or by a non-Jew. (A Rav should be consulted.) • The prohibition of building and dismantling applies regardless of the size. • Adding or removing a single nail in the sukkah is prohibited.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1139.

218,27/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  NORMAL USAGE,"We have seen that building, adding, or removing a fixture of a building constitutes a Torah prohibition. However, if the normal way of using it is to add and remove it regularly, 1142 one is permitted to do so. 1143 The prohibition only applies to creating or adding to the structure, not to day-to-day usage. Building implies a more long-term act of fixing. 1144 Practical Examples Opening and Closing a Door Opening and closing a door are not considered building or dismantling, as these are normal functions of a door. Similarly, one may open and close a trap door that is connected with hinges or has a handle. (One may not install it). Putting Up a Hammock It is prohibited to put up a hammock from wall to wall that will last for more than a few days. 1145 However, if it is already connected to the wall from before Shabbos, and one regularly opens and closes it, he is permitted to do so (but he must not make knots to secure it). 1146 Note that attaching anything to a tree on Shabbos is prohibited because using a tree is forbidden (see Day___). If, before Shabbos, the rope of the ham- mock was attached to a nail that was in the tree, one may lie on it, as long as the tree itself will not move, as trees are muktzeh . Garden Umbrella or Awning It is forbidden to open a garden umbrella that is already fixed into its base under the table if it is expected to remain open for more than a few days. If one regularly opens and closes a garden umbrella or awning, he may do so on Shabbos. 1147 Adding a Shelf to a Refrigerator Adding a shelf to a refrigerator may constitute a Torah prohibition unless it is regularly removed and replaced. However, placing magnets on the refrigerator is permitted, as long as one does not plan to leave them there for an extended period, and one does not create a word or image (See Day___). 1148 Key Holder One may hang keys onto a key holder that is on a wall, as this is its regular usage. Clocks and Paintings One should preferably be stringent not to hang a clock or a painting on the wall (even if the nail is already there from before Shabbos), as it is likely to remain there for an extended period of time. 1149 Connecting the Chains in the Aron Kodesh Connecting the ends of a chain to the walls inside an Aron Kodesh to prevent the Sifrei Torah from falling out is permitted. 1150 Floor Drains with Handles In apartments that have floor drains, one may only remove the drain if it has a designated handle that is made for regular usage, or if it attached with hinges. 1151 Rubber Sink Plug One may plug a sink with a rubber plug on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1141.

219,28/02/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  A PERMANENT OHEL,"Included in the Torah prohibition of boneh is making or adding to a perma- nent ohel — a roof or canopy, even if it is not a building. 1153 Any canopy or shade that is more than_ tefach (3.15 inches/8 centimeters) and is placed more than_ tefach (3.15 inches/8 centimeters) above what it is shading is forbidden. 1154 This is even if it will only last a few days. 1155 Whether the ohel will be used or not is not relevant, nor whether it is tied down or merely placed. Needless to say, it is also prohibited to dismantle any such ohel . Note that most permanent canopies are prohibited because of boneh itself, aside from ohel . • It is prohibited to put up a tent with a roof that is wider than_.15 inch- es/8 centimeters, even if the poles that it rests on are already standing. See footnote for further conditions. 1156 Leniencies If there is no_.15 inch/8 centimeter space between the canopy and the item under it, it is permitted. • One may put a tablecloth on a table on Shabbos, even if it will last for a few weeks (if it is needed on Shabbos). Although it creates a canopy over the table, there is no gap of_.15 inches/8 centimeters between the tablecloth and the table that creates an ohel . 1157 If the canopy is already attached with hinges or hooks, 1158 it is considered the same as the door of a building, and one may open or close it as he wishes because that is the normal way to use it. 1159 • One may open and close an awning on Shabbos, as the lever is no dif- ferent from a door handle for regular use of the awning. 1160 • One may open or close an existing plastic cover of a stroller, as it is already attached to it. 1161 • One may open or close the existing cover of his sukkah if it is perma- nently attached, as doing so is the way that it is normally used. 1162 • It is permitted to open up a folding deck chair, bed, or table on Shabbos because the hinges are fully attached, 1163 making it similar to a door. But one is not allowed to assemble a crib using its parts. 1164 It is permitted to turn an item over, as it is not a genuine act of making a canopy. • One may turn over a pot even if it will create a_.15 inch/8 centimeter canopy, as that is not considered a real act of building. 1165 In Summary • It is prohibited to make a permanent canopy, even with no walls. • If the gap is less than_.15 inches/8 centimeters, or it is attached with hinges for normal protracting and detracting, it is permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1152.

220,01/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  A TEMPORARY OHEL,"We have seen that making or adding to a permanent ohel (canopy) consti- tutes a Torah prohibition (even on the rare occasions that it does not constitute boneh ’s basic definition). Chazal also prohibited making a temporary ohel , as it may lead to trans- gressing the Torah prohibition of making a permanent ohel . In the same way, dismantling it is also Rabbinically prohibited. However, there is a slight leniency regarding a temporary ohel . Though making a permanent ohel is always forbidden, making a temporary ohel de- pends on the circumstances. If it has walls, it is prohibited. If it lacks walls, it is only prohibited if done for the benefit of what it is shading underneath it. 1167 The consequences of this seemingly insignificant detail are quite far reaching, as we will see. Practical Applications Mosquito Nets One may not cover a bed, hammock, crib, or stroller with a mosquito net, as this is a temporary canopy. This is prohibited even if there are no walls, as the net is made to protect what is underneath it. 1168 Children’s Games A child who is old enough to understand that there are actions that are forbidden on Shabbos (see Day___—420 for details) may not build a hut as a game (even in the house), even if it will not last a few days. 1169 Note that one may not take down such a structure, as doing so constitutes a Rabbinical violation of soser (disassembling). This is true regardless of who put it up, be it an older child who should not have done so or a younger child who was allowed to do so. Caps and Hats A baseball cap with a brim that stretches out more than_.15 inches/8 cen- timeters is considered a temporary canopy, and is Rabbinically prohibited to be worn, because it is worn to shade the head below it. 1170 A black hat or shtreimel that is worn in honor of Hashem is permitted, because it is not done to benefit what is below it. 1171 Umbrellas One may not open an umbrella, as it automatically creates a temporary ohel for what is below it. 1172 It is forbidden to use an umbrella on Shabbos even if it was open from before Shabbos. In addition, some Poskim rule that it is muktzeh . 1173 Placing a Horizontal Board onto Table Legs It is permitted to place a horizontal board onto the legs of a table, as there are no walls and the purpose of the board is to be used above it, not below it. Howev- er, if the base of the table forms walls on all sides of the table, it is prohibited. 1174 Placing a Book on Top of Two Vertical Books It is permitted to rest a book onto two upright books, 1175 as there are no walls and it is not being placed for what is below it. Note that regarding vertical sefarim that are not already in place, one should ideally avoid doing so even during the week, as it is a slight to their holiness. 1176 A Summary So Far • It is prohibited to make a permanent canopy, even the roof without any walls. However, if the gap is less than_.15 inches/8 centimeters, or it is attached with hinges and normally added and removed, it is permitted to do so if one is not actually building. • It is prohibited to make a temporary canopy. However, making a roof without walls is permitted if it is not being done for the sake of the space below it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1166. Known as  ohel arai .

221,02/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: ADDING TO A  TEMPORARY OHEL,"We have discussed that making or adding to a permanent ohel (canopy) constitutes a Torah prohibition, and that making a temporary canopy constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. We also discussed a leniency in the Rabbinic prohibi- tion — making a canopy without walls is permitted if not done for the sake of what is below it. The Rabbinic prohibition includes another practical leniency: one can add to a temporary canopy that is already open at least_.15 inches/8 centimeters from before Shabbos began. 1178 Practical Applications The Cover of a Stroller It is forbidden to place a plastic cover over a stroller, as it is a temporary ohel that protects what is below it. However, if one stretched a cover_.15 inches/8 centimeters over the stroller before Shabbos came in, it is permitted to extend it further on Shabbos____ and retract or remove it later. 1180 As mentioned previously, a cover that is attached with hinges and is used regularly to open and close may be used freely on Shabbos. Extending an Existing Cover with a Blanket We have seen that one may open an attached plastic cover over a stroller, as it was designed for constant opening and closing (unless it constitutes an ohel — see the above entry). Once the cover is extended_.15 inches/8 centimeters, and so a temporary ohel exists, one may also drape a blanket over it and the remaining uncovered area, as that is considered adding to a temporary canopy, which is permitted. 1181 Covering a Sukkah with a Piece of Plastic A sukkah is already covered with schach . One may add to that cover using plastic, as it is considered adding to a temporary dwelling, which is permitted. But one must ensure that plastic cover is placed directly on the schach , without creating a new canopy. Furthermore, one must be careful not to move the schach , as it is muktzeh . 1182 Adding a Leaf to a Table As we have said before, although placing the top of a table onto its legs is permitted because it is only intended to benefit what is above it, one may not place the top onto a base that extends on all four sides like wall. Still, if the top was already placed on such a base before Shabbos began, it is permitted to make a gap and loosely add another plank (without the need to screw or tightly insert it into grooves) in order to extend the table. 1183 (See also Day___.) A Summary of the Halachos of Ohel • It is prohibited to make a permanent canopy, even without adding walls. • It is prohibited to make a temporary canopy with walls (i.e., sides). However, one may make a temporary canopy without walls if it is not for the benefit of what is below it. Extending a temporary canopy that existed from before Shabbos is permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1177. Known as  mosif al ohel arai .

222,03/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  COVERING A LARGE POT,"We have seen that making a temporary canopy with sides is always prohib- ited. However, making a temporary ohel without sides is only prohibited if it is for the benefit of what is below it. Also, extending an already-existing temporary canopy is permitted. Covering a large pot Covering a large pot protects the contents of the pot, effectively making it a temporary ohel , which is Rabbinically forbidden. 1185 Nevertheless, it is still the subject of a dispute among the Poskim . The parameters of “large” are also unclear. 1186 One may certainly cover it in a way that it is not fully covered. This is how we rule on this subject: • Regarding an industrial-sized pot (such as those used in yeshivos and camps), one should ideally not cover the pot with plastic or foil. 1187 It is praiseworthy even to be stringent____ not to cover it with the cover that is made to fit it. 1189 If one has done so or needs to do so, there are Poskim to rely on. 1190 (Any plastic or foil must be cut before Shabbos.) • Regarding a normal- or medium-sized pot, it is permitted to cover it with plastic, foil, or the cover that is made to fit it. 1191 (Here too, some are stringent. 1192 ) • As always, if the cover is already on at least_.15 inches/8 centimeters, one may move it to extend to more of the pot. • As always, if there is no_.15 inch/8 centimeter gap between the cover and the pot’s contents (such as in the case of a pan or when the pot is completely full), it is always permitted to cover it. 1193 There are opinions that the same halachos apply to removing such a cover from these pots. 1194",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1184.

223,04/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: A MECHITZAH,"We have covered two topics in boneh and soser so far: • Boneh and soser — the basic prohibition: erecting, adding to, or dis- mantling a permanent structure. This prohibition also applies to plac- ing things on the ground in a permanent fashion and adding to large movable items. • Ohel — setting up a canopy. If it is permanent, it is prohibited even if made without walls. If it is temporary, it is permitted if it is made without walls and is not for the sake of what is below it. Otherwise, it is forbidden. Extending a temporary canopy is permitted. Although Chazal prohibited erecting a temporary ohel , that is, making a horizontal roof-like cover, they still allowed placing erect a temporary partition, or vertical divider, known as a mechitzah , 1196 with one exception — a mechitzah that creates a Halachic distinction is still prohibited. A temporary mechitzah that is just for privacy is permitted, but if it will create a situation that will make a new reality in Halachah, it is forbidden. (Obviously, this is only permitted where making the mechitzah will not entail building or any other melachah , but rather just raising a preexisting item to be vertical in a place where it will not remain indefinitely.) Mechitzos That Do Not Have HALACHIC REMIFICATIONS As we have explained, a temporary mechitzah that does not have Hala- chic ramifications may be placed, as long as it is not meant to remain there indefinitely. • Although it is critical to have a mechitzah in a shul to separate men and women, it is not considered a Halachic wall, because the main purpose is to divide (and not to create a new enclosure). 1197 Thus, one may put up a temporary mechitzah in order to separate men and women in shul. 1198 Note that even permissible non-Halachic mechitzos may not be placed in a way that is permanent. • Hanging and tying a tablecloth that will separate men and women, such as in shul or for sheva brachos , is prohibited under boneh (building), if one intends to keep it there indefinitely. It is worth noting that one may ask a non-Jew to raise up a temporary mechitzah even if it has a Halachic ramification, if it is necessary for a mitzvah. 1199",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1195.

224,05/03/2026,"BONEH AND SOSER:  A MECHITZAH, CONTINUED","We have seen that Chazal allowed one to create a mechitzah (temporary partition) (a roof or canopy is forbidden). 1201 However, putting up a mechitzah is prohibited if it creates a Halachic distinction. Here are a few applications. Examples of Halachic Mechitzos A Sukkah Wall A classic example of a Halachic mechitzah is a third sukkah wall. A sukkah requires at least two walls and a third wall____ that is_.15 inches/8 centimeters wide. 1203 If one had two sukkah walls, he may not bring a small bookshelf (even though it is temporary and already built) to make up the third wall. This is be- cause such a wall validates the sukkah. (Note that closing a window or door is permitted, because these are attached with hinges that are made for day-to-day use [see Day___].) An Eiruv We have seen that in order to carry in a resort, there are four requirements: 1. It must be fenced off; 2. One must make an eiruv chatzeiros with the other observant Jews; 3. One must rent the rights from the management or all of the non-Jewish or nonobservant Jewish residents to use the property freely; and_. there isn’t about__,186 square feet (one-third of an acre)/1,225 square meters of uninhabitable land inside it (see Days___—152). If there was no fence around the resort, one may not bring such a fence to place around it on Shabbos. As doing so effects permissibility to carry in the enclosure, 1204 creating such a Halachic wall on Shabbos is forbidden. A Partition to Separate Oneself from One Who Is Davening Halachah states that one may not walk within_ amos (6.3 feet/1.9 meters) in front of one who is davening Shemoneh Esrei . This is because the Shechinah (Divine Presence) is present in that place, and also because it is improper to disrupt the person. However, if there is a wall or a partition__ tefachim (31.5 inches/80 centimeters) high and__.75 inches/40 centimeters wide, one is per- mitted to pass, as there is a separation. On Shabbos, placing a partition between oneself and someone who is davening____ is forbidden. 1206 Blocking Light or Items of Kedushah One may not have marital relations in a room that is light or has holy books, Sifrei Torah , or tefillin (see Day___). 1207 One may also not change a baby’s di- aper in such a room. A divider (at least__.5 inches/80 centimeters high) that blocks light from coming in or divides the room from items of kedushah renders the room permissible to use. Thus, it is forbidden to put up such a mechitzah on Shabbos. 1208 However, one may put up such a divider before Shabbos and extend it on Shabbos. 1209 Finding Chametz on Pesach If one finds chametz on Pesach, he is required to make a barrier to prevent anyone from eating it. 1210 Although a temporary partition would suffice, one may not put one up on Yom Tov because it is a Halachic partition. Instead, he should cover the chametz with a vessel. 1211",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1200. Known as  mechitzas arai . It is permitted for the sake of privacy.

However, if it has a form in its own right, it may not be held up, as the fact that a person is holding it does not change its status of an ohel . 1214 Practical Applications Kol HaNe’arim On Simchas Torah, the custom is to hold up a tallis over all of the children as they receive an aliyah . This is known as Kol HaNe’arim . This is permitted even though the tallis forms a canopy over them, as the shape of the ohel is only due to the fact that it is held. (See the footnote for another reason that this is permitted. 1215 ) However, a tallis or chuppah cloth that was already attached to a frame is forbidden, as the shape of the canopy exists without people holding it. 1216 (This is also one of the reasons that an umbrella is forbidden. 1217 ) Covering the Head during Birchas Kohanim Some people have the custom to cover the heads of their children with a tallis during Birchas Kohanim . Although it may form a canopy above them, it is permitted, as the shape of the canopy is formed by the one holding it. (See the footnote for another reason why this is permitted. 1218 ) Covering One’s Head in the Rain While walking in a place where there is a valid eiruv , one may hold a jack- et____ over his head to protect himself from the sun or rain, because the canopy being created only holds its shape through the person holding it up (unlike an umbrella).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1212.

226,07/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  LEVELING THE GROUND;  SWEEPING,"Leveling the Ground____ Before any building can be accomplished, the ground must be level. Thus, flattening the ground in order to build falls under the Torah prohibition of boneh . 1221 • Stamping one’s feet on a bumpy dirt path in order to make it level con- stitutes the Torah prohibition. 1222 • Pouring small stones or sand onto a walkway in order to flatten it in order to fix it constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1223 Sweeping In addition, Chazal prohibited a number of actions that may lead to trans- gressing the Torah prohibition of leveling the ground (and these apply even if the sand is in a vessel____ ). One may not sweep a sand floor in any place. One may also not sweep a carpet, as vigorously rubbing a fabric constitutes melaben (whitening). 1225 However, the minhag____ is that one may sweep an indoor floor that is tiled____ if most of the houses in the city are tiled, paved, or carpeted. In the event that one is in a third-world area where most houses tend to have dirt floors, sweeping remains prohibited even in those houses that have tiled floors. One is not allowed to sweep a sukkah that is on grass or sand. 1228 Further- more, if most of the courtyards in one’s area are not tiled or carpeted, it is for- bidden to sweep in a sukkah that is built in a courtyard, even if it is paved. One may ask a non-Jew to sweep any surface if it is a genuine need or for a mitzvah. 1229 Brooms One may not use a reed or straw broom, 1230 as the teeth will inevitably be- come dislodged, constituting the Torah prohibition of soser (disassembling). 1231 Furthermore, such a broom is muktzeh . 1232 Also, one should preferably designate a separate broom____ for Shabbos use, as using the same broom as used during the week presents an issue of uvdin d’chol (weekday activities). Pushing Heavy Containers One may not push a large or heavy container on an outdoor surface, as it will cause the ground to be flattened. 1234 Nowadays, 1235 one may do so indoors on a tiled or carpeted surface. 1236",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1219.

227,08/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: FLATTENING THE  GROUND;   PLAYING GAMES,"We have seen that, in addition to the Torah prohibition of flattening a dirt surface in order to build on it, Chazal also prohibited certain actions that could lead to doing so. We will now bring a few more practical applications of this prohibition. • One may not play with marbles (or other toys that involve sweeping across the surface) on any dirt surface, 1238 even if it is currently flat, 1239 because one may come to flatten any bumps. However, one may play with them on a tiled floor inside the house, or on a table. 1240 • One may not play soccer or cricket on a soil or grass surface, lest he come to flatten it____ or uproot grass. One may play these games____ inside a house on a tiled or carpeted floor. 1243 (In general, the per- missibility of playing with balls on Shabbos is questionable even on a permitted surface, 1244 but one need not prevent children from playing with them. 1245 ) • Although there is a dispute whether or not balls are considered muktzeh , one may be lenient and play table tennis on Shabbos (even outdoors____ ) as there is no issue of leveling the ground (as opposed to the above examples of soccer and cricket). • One may be lenient and allow children to play in a dry sandbox, 1247 under two conditions: it was designated for use on Shabbos before Shabbos, 1248 and the sand is very light and fine. 1249 This prevents the sand from being muktzeh , and any holes will automatically be filled by falling sand as the children dig. 1250 One may not add sand or water to a sandbox on Shabbos. Sand that was not designated before Shabbos is muktzeh , and may not be handled (see Day___). • One may not thrust something into dirt or sand on Shabbos, 1251 even if the ground is not used for planting. Therefore, one may not sit on a chair that will definitely sink into the sand, creating a hole upon its removal. 1252 However, one may remove something from the sand. • One may not rub phlegm or saliva into any surface, even if it is tiled. However, one is allowed to tread on it (if it is displeasing to the eye) without rubbing it in. 1253",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1237. Known as  gezeiras meshaveh gumos .

228,09/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: REBUILDING  MOVABLE ITEMS,"We mentioned that building or adding to a large movable item constitutes the melachah of boneh . Obviously, building from scratch any vessel that did not exist before Shab- bos is also prohibited. Similarly, dismantling such a vessel is forbidden under soser . 1255 There is a dispute whether rebuilding a small item is prohibited or not. The Mishnah Berurah rules that one is not permitted to rebuild a small item on Shabbos. 1256 Furthermore, one may not cut an opening to make a vessel usable on Shabbos. 1257 Breaking a vessel is also prohibited if it makes the vessel usable, known as makkeh b’patish . 1258 Bear in mind that we are only dealing with those things that were already used, and then broke or were dismantled before Shabbos. Generally, anything that breaks on Shabbos is considered muktzeh . Rebuilding something falls into one of three categories: 1. The Torah prohibition — fastening tightly: Attaching different parts of an item using screws, nails, or glue, or even attaching in a way that will be difficult to undo____ constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1260_. The Rabbinic prohibition — connecting not very tightly: Attaching different parts of an item in a way that they are not fixed or attached well and are therefore easy to undo, constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 1261 Chazal were concerned that one may come to transgress the above To- rah prohibition. This is only forbidden if the item is capable of being tightly fastened, as above. 3. Permitted — connecting things that are always loose: 1262 Loosely attaching____ different parts of an item that are always loose is permitted. Practical Examples • Screwing in the horizontal bar of a bench (that had been used and dis- connected before Shabbos) into its legs constitutes the Torah prohibi- tion. Loosely screwing it into its legs constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Placing the horizontal bar onto its legs without screwing anything in is permitted. • Screwing in an extra leaf in a table constitutes the Torah prohibition. Adding it in to a table without screwing it but in a way that it remain somewhat inserted into the grooves constitutes a Rabbinic prohibi- tion. However, fitting the slate into a table in a way that it is never solidly inserted is permitted. 1264 (See also Day___ regarding extending an ohel .) • Screwing the sidepiece of one’s glasses frame that fell out before Shabbos constitutes the Torah prohibition. Loosely screwing the sidepiece into one’s glasses frame, even when it is not fixed in, constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. In addition, the pieces that broke off from the glasses on Shabbos are muktzeh . • Screwing a broom stick into a broom that was disconnected before Shabbos constitutes the Torah prohibition. Loosely fitting it in consti- tutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 1265 • Clicking the removable parts of a chair or bed into place constitutes the Torah prohibition. Loosely placing them into the grooves constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Placing them into the form of a chair without using any screws or grooves, in a way that they would easily fall out, is permitted. 1266 As always, wherever rebuilding an item is forbidden, dismantling it is also forbidden.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1254.

229,10/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  CHILDREN’S TOYS,"We have seen that there are three categories with regard to reassembling vessels: 1. Screwing or attaching parts properly to rebuild an item constitutes the Torah prohibition. 2. Screwing or attaching them loosely constitutes a Rabbinic prohi- bition. 3. It is permitted to reattach something that may not be fixed or is loose in nature. The Normal Function There is a fourth category, that is permitted to do: connecting or discon- necting for normal use. The same principle that we have already applied to boneh and soser applies here — when the normal function of an item is to regularly be connected or disconnected, it does not constitute a melachah . • It is permitted to screw on the top of a baby bottle. • One may adjust the height of an adjustable shtender (lectern), as that is its normal function. Blocks and Toys There is a debate regarding blocks, Magna-Tiles, or any other toy of this kind that one is able to build things from. 1268 On one hand, assembling them creates a functional object, 1269 which should constitute boneh . On the other hand, they are designed to be regularly assembled and disassembled. Furthermore, they are rarely built to last more than a few hours. Although an adult (above the age of bar or bas mitzvah) should not build with these blocks on Shabbos, one may allow children to play with them. 1270 However, any toys, such as Lego or Clics, that lock tightly in a way that they will remain attached indefinitely should be avoided. Furthermore, anything that requires screwing things in (even if the item is plastic) or uses other sophisticated locking mechanisms is certainly forbidden. • One may allow children to build houses out of big Lego blocks that remain somewhat loose, and certainly with Magna-Tiles. However, if the Lego set uses sophisticated locking mechanisms or screws, it may not be used. • One may not allow children to build model planes or boats if they are designed to stay built indefinitely. As mentioned earlier, building a_.15 inch/8 centimeter canopy or roof to cover something_.15 inches/8 centimeters below it is forbidden. 1271 Even when children play with toys that are permitted, they may not build such a canopy.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1267.

230,11/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER:  METAL CONTAINERS AND CAPS,"Most metal containers are sealed automatically by heating a piece of foil around the opening. Until one actually opens that lid, it is unusable — it is not yet a vessel. 1273 Opening such a container causes it or its lid to become func- tional for the first time, 1274 which is tantamount to building a vessel (or at least completing it), 1275 which is forbidden on Shabbos. As a general rule, one should open all such containers before Shabbos. 1276 Because of this, 1277 one may not open any of the following for the first time on Shabbos: • A new bottle of grape juice with a metal cap. (See Day___ regarding plastic caps.) • A new can of tuna or fruit • A new soda can with a metal tab Options, in Order of Preference: • Ideally, one must open these before Shabbos. (It is advisable to appoint one person to take care of all containers every week before Shabbos.) • If one did not open one of these, he may destroy the cap or container. This can be done by puncturing the lid or cap or the underside of the can, rendering it unusable. Once the container is unusable, he may open it normally. This is because a new opening is irrelevant once the entire vessel is useless. 1278 One must also throw the cap away. • Some Poskim rule that one may open the metal cap normally if he does not detach it (he must leave it hanging), such as in the case of a new soda can. 1279 • Some Poskim hold that one may ask a non-Jew to open these contain- ers on Shabbos in cases of extreme need. 1280 (Bear in mind that wine and grape juice handled by a non-Jew is forbidden unless it is mevushal (boiled). The label should indicate whether it is mevushal . There are different opinions regarding what extent of heating is considered enough to render a wine mevushal — a Rav should be consulted in case of doubt.) • One must open up all bottles of wine and grape juice before the Pesach Seder. If one did not, he may puncture a hole in the metal cap (destroy- ing it) and then open it normally. Alternatively, he may carefully open them up without detaching the caps from the rings. Bottles of mevushal wine and grape juice that are required for the Seder may be opened by a non-Jew.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1272. Known as  asiyas pesach.  See  Shabbos  146a.

231,12/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: PLASTIC AND  PAPER CONTAINERS AND CAPS,"We have discussed opening metal containers and caps, which is forbidden on Shabbos. It is advisable to open all such containers before Shabbos. Disposable Plastic or Paper Containers Some Poskim are lenient regarding plastic containers because the attached cap is already considered complete. It is a vessel in its own right that is merely fitted onto the container. It follows that opening such a container for the first time is not tantamount to creating a vessel, but rather, splitting a vessel from its base. However, this is only permitted for containers that will ulti- mately be thrown away, 1282 in other words, creating such an opening is not a long-term benefit. 1283 It is also preferable to make the opening in an unusual manner. 1284 (See the next paragraph, as there are those who prohibit opening these as well.) Because of this, it is permitted to open the following (though some say that it should preferably be done in an unusual manner____ ): • A bottle of soda • A new carton (or bag) of milk • A new bag of nosh • A new sugar packet, but not if the edges are stuck together • A container with a cap that tears a seal as it is turned Note that one must avoid opening any item that by doing so, he would be separating or cutting letters (see Day___.) Being Stringent Even with Plastic and Paper It is worth mentioning that some Poskim are stringent regarding plastic or paper containers as well, and require that they be destroyed before opening. 1286 Everyone agrees that one should try to open even plastic and paper containers before Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1281.

232,13/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: BRAIDING HAIR,"The Talmud says that when Chavah (Eve) was created, she was adorned with beautiful braids. 1288 The Torah uses the word “building” when describing this. Thus, braiding is considered a form of building, 1289 and is forbidden on Shabbos____ even on a doll or wig. 1291 It follows that undoing braids on Shabbos constitutes soser , and is also prohibited. If one’s hair is braided, she may remove the holders if the entire braid will not become undone immediately. 1292 • One may not braid their daughter’s hair on Shabbos. If it was already in a braid, one may not undo it. If it had bands attached at the ends, one may remove them, provided that the braid will not become undone immediately. Also, one may put hair into a ponytail without braiding it. Wigs One is also prohibited to braids hairs that are detached from their roots, such as those on a wig. 1293 Furthermore, it is prohibited to spray mousse, hair spray, or gel onto one’s hair or wig to keep the hair in place. 1294 Some Poskim rule that one may not comb a wig on Shabbos. If one must do so, she should brush lightly with a brush that has very soft bristles and has ideally been designated to be used only on Shabbos. 1295 Pei’os One may not twirl his pei’os (sidelocks) on Shabbos in order to permanently shape them. However, if they were already twirled and shaped, he may twirl them further. 1296",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1287. Known as  kliyas sei’ar .

233,14/03/2026,BONEH AND SOSER: A REVIEW AND  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF SOSER,"We explained that wherever boneh applies, dismantling those objects con- stitutes soser . We will now recap the rules of boneh , bringing practical examples of the prohibition of soser . See the footnotes that indicate on which Day number the relevant halachos were brought. The Basic Torah Prohibition of Boneh and Soser The basic prohibition is to build or disassemble a fixed structure. 1297 • It is forbidden to remove a wall, door, nail, or shelf on Shabbos in order to build in that space. • It is forbidden to remove a light bulb from an electric socket. • Some people have filters on their taps so that the water is automatically fil- tered before it exits. Removing such a pipe or filter from the tap is forbidden. Disassembling Applies on the Ground____ The prohibition applies even to adjustments made on the ground, not just on walls and structures. • It is forbidden to remove bricks or pebbles to make the ground usable. • It is forbidden to remove a wire from a fence. Disassembling Applies to Large Movable Items____ Some objects are so big that they are Halachically considered fixed struc- tures in their own right, even though they are portable. Removing a permanent fixture from such an object constitutes soser and is prohibited. Any vessel capable of holding more than___ gallons/680 liters, or an average person’s volume, is subject to the Torah prohibitions of boneh and soser . Note that disassembling smaller items may also be Rabbinically prohibited. • It is forbidden to remove a shelf from a large bookcase or refrigerator. • It is forbidden to puncture a large wine barrel. • It is forbidden to remove a hubcap from a car. Disassembling Part of a Structure Is Also Prohibited____ Even removing part of a permanent structure is forbidden. • One may not remove a mezuzah on Shabbos. • One may not remove part of an eiruv on Shabbos. • If a window shattered, one may not remove the broken glass from the frame, as it constitutes soser . If leaving it is dangerous, he may ask a non- Jew to remove it, or remove it with a shinui (abnormally).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,1297. See Days 179—180.
234,15/03/2026,"BONEH AND SOSER: REVIEW AND  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF SOSER,  CONTINUED","Normal Usage Is Permitted____ If the normal way of using an item is to put it on and remove it regularly, it is permitted. The prohibitions of boneh and soser do not apply to day-to-day use. Something that is normally constantly removed and inserted does not constitute boneh or soser . • Opening a door or curtain is permitted, as doing so is a normal function. Similarly, one may open and close a trap door. (However, one may not install one.) • It is prohibited to install a toilet paper-roll or towel holder onto a bath- room wall. However, taking out the bar in order to put on a new roll or towel is permitted, 1302 because that is the way it is used. (Generally, using toilet paper on Shabbos is prohibited [see Day___].) • One may remove a hammock that is regularly put up and taken down. • One may remove temporary magnets from a metal surface such as a refrigerator, as they are not at all fixed. 1303 • The Poskim debate whether removing a clock or painting from a wall (assuming the nail is already there) constitutes soser . However, all agree that an expensive item is muktzeh , and may not be moved. • It is permitted to disconnect the ends of a chain from the walls of an Aron Kodesh in order to remove the Torah scrolls. • In apartments that have floor drains, one may lift the handle of the drain if it is made to be removed regularly or if it is attached by hinges. Removing a Permanent Ohel Constitutes a Torah Prohibition____ We have seen that setting up an ohel (a fixed roof or canopy that is at least_.15 inches/8 centimeters wide and at least_.15 inches/8 centimeters above the surface) is included in the Torah prohibition of boneh . Removing such a canopy is also prohibited. • It is forbidden to remove a permanent shade. • It is forbidden to remove an existing tent (that has a_.15 inch/8 centi- meter wide flat roof at the top) is prohibited. • It is forbidden to remove a fixed standing chuppah (bridal canopy) from its four poles. Leniencies: Not a Real Canopy If there lacks a space of_.15 inches/8 centimeters between the item and the canopy, it is permitted. • It is permitted to remove a tablecloth from a table because there is no gap of_.15 inches/8 centimeters between it and the table. Furthermore, if the roof is already attached using hinges or hooks, it is consid- ered the same as the door of a building, and one may open or close it as he wishes. • One may open and close an awning, sukkah cover, and stroller cover on Shabbos if it is attached with hinges, hooks, levers, or Velcro.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1298.

236,17/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK  (WRITING AND ERASING),"Introduction Two of the creative acts that took place in the Mishkan were writing and erasing. Therefore, writing and erasing on Shabbos constitute Torah prohibi- tions. The basic prohibition is writing or creating____ a letter, sign, 1311 number, or line____ (see the footnote____ ). Any time that kosev is prohibited, erasing such shapes or letters constitutes the Torah prohibition of mochek . The Three Categories of Kosev The Torah Prohibition To transgress the Torah prohibition, the writing must be enduring, 1314 and the surface must be enduring. 1315 • One who writes with a pen on a piece of paper has transgressed the Torah prohibition. • One who carves letters on a stone has transgressed the Torah prohi- bition. The Rabbinic Prohibition If the writing will not endure or the surface will not endure, or both, it still constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 1316 • One who makes letters out of tomato sauce or ketchup that has spilled on the table transgresses a Rabbinic prohibition. 1317 • One who writes letters in sand has transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition. • One who writes letters on a foggy window has transgressed a Rabbinic prohibition. 1318 • One who writes on a leaf (which will eventually disintegrate) has trans- gressed a Rabbinic prohibition. Permitted One may motion letters or shapes in the air____ or on a surface. • One may motion to his friend, even if he is forming shapes or letters. • One may form shapes or letters in the sun, even though it will create shadows of what he is forming. 1320 As we have mentioned, wherever it is forbidden to write, it will also forbid- den to erase what was already written.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1307.

237,18/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK:  OTHER FORMS OF WRITING,"We have seen that the prohibitions of kosev and mochek fall into three cat- egories: • If the ink is enduring and the surface is enduring, it constitutes the Torah prohibition. • If the ink will not endure or the surface will not endure, or both, it still constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. • If no real letter or shape is made, such as in the case of shadows or finger motions, it is permitted. The prohibition of kosev or mochek applies even if the letters do not form a real word and regardless of the language. 1321 Other Types of Writing The prohibitions of kosev and mochek include creating any meaningful symbol. Therefore, the following cases are also included in the prohibition. (Some are Torah prohibitions, and some are Rabbinic.) • Scratching____ or carving into a surface____ • Using a stamp____ • Cutting or forming a letter using paper____ • Lining up food to form an image or symbol • Assembling a puzzle that will form a picture____ • Erasing part of one letter to create a different one, such as making an m into an n____ • Making a fingerprint (deliberately) • Sticking letter stickers onto a surface, as it creates a meaningful symbol • Sticking Deluxe Scrabble pieces into their fitted grooves • Pressing letters into the icing of a chocolate cake to form words • Attaching magnetic letters to a shul’s metal Aliyah Board____ As we have explained previously, erasing in all of the above cases is prohib- ited under mochek .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1321.

238,19/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK: UNITING TWO  THINGS TO FORM AN IMAGE,"We have seen that kosev and mochek are not limited to using a pen and paper. Rather, anything that produces a meaningful impression is prohibited. We will now discuss bringing two letters or two parts of a single letter to- gether to create a word. One can be lenient and bring two complete letters that form one word or image together, provided that they remain physically separate. 1329 But attaching them in any way is considered an act of writing, and is prohibited. Similarly, one may bring two parts of one letter together if they remain physically sep- arate. 1330 Practical Applications Bringing Torn Pieces of Paper Together One may bring together two pieces of a paper that was torn apart, 1331 even if it creates a word or letter, 1332 provided that he does not attach them together. Although all agree that one may do so as long as there is a gap between the letters, it is better to avoid doing so if one has another option. Scrabble One may bring Scrabble letters together even though they will form a word. However, one may not place them into a frame or slot, as they will then be con- sidered attached, which is forbidden. Opening and Closing a Book It is better to avoid using a book that has writing on the sides of the pages that form a word as they come together. 1333 If one has no other option, it is permitted. If the sides of the pages come together without forming anything meaningful, all agree that it is permitted to close the book. 1334",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1322. Shabbos  102b.

239,20/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK:  ATTACHING TWO FORMS OR LETTERS  TO THE SAME SURFACE,"We have seen that one may bring two complete letters closer to each other so long as they are not attached to each other in any way, even though they will form a word. However, attaching them to the same surface or frame is considered newly forming a word, and is therefore forbidden. One may still do so by leaving a significant space between them. Practical Applications Magnets on a Refrigerator Bringing two magnets next to each other to form an image or word is for- bidden, because they are considered attached via the refrigerator. 1335 However, if one leaves a significant space between them, it is permissible, as long as one does not leave it there for an extended period (See Day___). Bulletin Boards Some shuls use a magnetic board to spell out names of donors and amounts of donations. It is forbidden to use this on Shabbos. Using a corkboard is also forbidden. Similarly, during sefiras ha’omer , some shuls place two numbers next to each other on a magnetic board to indicate the day. It is forbidden to do this on Shab- bos. 1336 If there is a significant space between them, it is permitted, provided that it will not remain that way for some time (otherwise it constitutes boneh and is forbidden). Placing page numbers on hooks where there is a recognizable gap between them is permitted since they are not forming a useful number. Again, this is only permitted if it will not remain there for some time. 1337 Puzzles One may not click pieces of puzzles firmly into each other to form an image, word, or letter, 1338 as they will be considered attached. 1339 (Puzzles often carry the prohibition of boneh as well. 1340 ) Similarly, placing them into a frame or grid, in which they will become fixed and thereby create a full picture (even though they are not actually attached) is forbidden. Deluxe Scrabble It is forbidden to slot Deluxe Scrabble pieces into a frame, as it is considered attaching letters to form words. As explained previously, using normal Scrabble or Rummikub tiles is permitted (if they remain separate). Attaching a Letter to a Curtain If a letter falls off the curtain of the Aron Kodesh , one may not pin it back up, even though using a single pin is not considered tofer (sewing). House Numbers and Letters If part of the house number or address on one’s residence falls off, he may not stick it back on. Doing so is also likely a prohibition of boneh . Moreover, the letter or number that fell is muktzeh .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1335. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  16:24. Note that Rav Nissim Karelitz held that it is not  considered a real attachment. Therefore, there is room to be lenient for children.

240,21/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK:  DESTROYING LETTERS AND WORDS - FOOD,"Food in the Shape of a Letter or Object When a cake or other food has been made in the shape of words or pictures, one may cut as he wishes even though he is effectively erasing that object. 1347 This is also permitted if the food has a word or picture carved into it. This is because the word or picture is simply the form of the cake, and not writing. This is unlike words or pictures on icing, which are not part of the cake and are Halachically considered writing.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1341. Based on  Teshuvas HaRama  119.

241,22/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK:  MAKING SHAPES OUT OF FOOD,"We have seen that: • Bringing together two letters to form a word or two parts of a letter to form the full letter is permitted if necessary, as long as they are not attached or together on a common surface. • Cutting between letters is permitted if necessary, but cutting a letter is forbidden. • Cutting a cake that is formed in a shape or letter or a food that has a word or image carved into it is permitted. We will now discuss making shapes out of food. Basic Shapes or Lines One may make basic shapes such as squares, triangles, and circles out of food as a sign, but not simply for presentation purposes. 1348 Thus, one may cut his food in a way that shows it belongs to him. One can also make lines in food in order to know where to cut or eat it, such as before cutting challah. 1349 Detailed Shapes One may not make anything more intricate than a basic shape, such as a face or a sun, or a letter in food. One may not use a scoop to make balls from watermelon. 1350 One may not bake a cake on Yom Tov by forming the dough into an intricate shape. 1351 However, one may bake it into a basic shape on Yom Tov, such as a square or triangle. Note that making fancy stands and designs using food on Shabbos consti- tutes the prohibition of boneh . 1352 As we have mentioned previously, making or erasing a letter or shape from a different substance, such as icing, is always forbidden on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1348.

242,23/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK:  ABNORMAL WRITING,"We have seen that kosev and mochek are not limited to using a pen and paper. Rather, anything that produces a meaningful impression is forbidden. Writing in an Unusual Manner It is important to note that writing abnormally is also prohibited. • One who writes using his nondominant hand or his mouth transgresses a Rabbinic prohibition. 1353 Moreover, if writing using one’s weaker hand will produce the same result as his stronger hand, it is considered writing in every way, and thus, constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1354 • If a right-handed person uses a stamp with his left hand, it still consti- tutes the Torah prohibition. 1355 • Typing on a typewriter using one’s left hand still constitutes a Torah prohibition. 1356 Similarly, using a copier, camera, or computer with one’s left hand is also prohibited. 1357 If one is ambidextrous regarding writing, using either hand to write consti- tutes the Torah prohibition. If a child holds a pen, and an adult maneuvers the child’s arm to produce letters, it constitutes a Torah prohibition for the adult, because the adult is ef- fectively doing the writing. 1358",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1353.

243,24/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK: WRITING  THAT DOES NOT LAST;  ELECTRONIC  WRITING;  VIDEO CAMERAS,"We have seen that writing constitutes the Torah prohibition only if the sur- face and the script are enduring. However, it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition even if the surface or the script is not enduring, or both. 1359 DEFINING ""ENDURING"" The exact time span of what is considered enduring, so that it will constitute a Torah prohibition, is a dispute among the Poskim . 1360 Practically, there is no difference — even if it does not endure, it still con- stitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. • It is forbidden to make letters or shapes on a misty window or in sand. • It is forbidden to scrape letters or symbols onto fruit, fruit peels, paper, or even crumbs. 1361 Invisible and Electronic Writing Video Cameras and Computers If one walks into a room that has video cameras, the lense captures his image and causes it to appear on a screen elsewhere, as well as being transcribed into data that is stored physically. Similarly, if one types on a computer, the word appears on the screen, and if he saves the document, the data is also written onto the computer’s hard drive. One should avoid being in a place where his image will be captured, al- though it is questionable if it is prohibited outright. 1362 In cases of need, one can be lenient. However, if the person uses the image to his benefit, it is definitely forbidden. A Jewish owner of such devices should turn off video cameras before Shabbos if they will produce pictures or videos that will benefit him. • If possible, one should approach a building via the pedestrian gate which does not have a camera, instead of the car gate which does have a camera. Either way, if the gate will open automatically because it has captured one’s picture, it is forbidden to deliberately approach the camera. • Although some people avoid going to the Kosel on Shabbos as there are video cameras all around, most Poskim permit it. • It is questionable whether one should approach the gate of a residence that has a video camera, as his image will be captured and shown on the screen (and certainly if the gates will open automatically). The owner of such a house should turn off his video camera before Shab- bos, as footage of passersby will definitely be of benefit to him. (In cases where these devices are used to prevent potential danger, a Rav should be consulted.) Thermometers We will learn that measuring is forbidden on Shabbos unless it is for a mitz- vah (see Day___). One is permitted to measure his temperature using a mercury (not digital) thermometer on Shabbos, 1363 even if his illness is not life threaten- ing, 1364 because staying healthy is a mitzvah . Using a digital thermometer causes the temperature to appear on the screen, which is a form of writing (aside from the issues involved with using electricity on Shabbos). 1365 Obviously, if there is the slightest hint of danger to life, all Shabbos prohibi- tions must be waivered without question. (However, in most of these situations, a thermometer is likely superfluous.) Film Cameras and Fax Machines Using a film camera is even more problematic than a video camera, as the image is captured onto actual film. Obviously, regardless, one may not use a camera because it uses electricity, but even being photographed (by a non-Jew) is forbidden. 1366 Needless to say, developing photographs constitutes the Torah prohibition of writing, as does sending a fax. 1367 NOTE: One may send a fax before Shabbos even though it will arrive in a place where Shabbos has already come in. Similarly, one may keep his fax ma- chine on during Shabbos even though it may accept documents on Shabbos, unless it is obvious that the sender will be desecrating Shabbos by doing so. But one may not read the fax on Shabbos, and if it is on a roll, he may not tear it off. 1368",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1359. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  340:4.

244,25/03/2026,KOSEV AND MOCHEK: ERASING,"Whenever writing something is forbidden, erasing it is also forbidden. Cov- ering something so that it may not be seen is also considered erasing, and is forbidden. • It is forbidden to scribble over a letter or blot it out so that it is no longer visible. Erasing falls into two categories: 1369 The Torah Prohibition Erasing in order to make the surface neater____ or in order to make space for writing even one letter____ constitutes the Torah prohibition of mochek . • Erasing a large M , thus allowing for the writing of two smaller letters, constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Erasing a letter that was written sloppily in order to rewrite it constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1372 • Erasing an extra letter in a Sefer Torah , thus rendering it kosher, consti- tutes the Torah prohibition. The Rabbinic Prohibition Chazal prohibited any erasing, even if one does not make any improvements or make space for writing two letters. • According to some Poskim , breaking open an egg, thus undoubtedly erasing the writing on its shell, constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition unless it is very necessary. • Smoking on Yom Tov (for those who allow it on Yom Tov) will cause the writing on the cigarette to be erased. One who is already a smoker should ideally erase the writing before Yom Tov. 1373 (Note that the per- missibility of smoking in general, and certainly of starting to smoke, is the subject of discussion among the Poskim , as it is a danger to one’s health.) • Cutting a fruit that has writing on it or a challah that has a sticker on it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition if one destroys letters. One should, therefore, take off the part of the challah or fruit with the sticker attached to it immediately before he plans to eat it (thereby also avoiding borer — see Day___). 1374 • Opening packages in a way that the letters on the package are destroyed constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 1375 Toilet Paper with Writing Some Poskim are stringent regarding using (already cut) toilet paper that has designs or words on it. However, in cases of need one certainly can be lenient. 1376 Putting a diaper with a picture or design onto a child is permitted according to all opinions, even if it will inevitably be covered or erased. Pages That Are Stuck Together One may not separate two pages on which there is writing that are stuck to each other if it will likely cause the letters to be erased. 1377 Even if one can do so without disturbing the letters, there is a prohibition of kore’a (tearing) to tear the paper. 1378 However, if the pages are laminated, one may separate them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1369.

Soaking Seeds One may not soak seeds in water, as they will eventually expand and grow roots. 1386 However, it is permitted to put the seeds into water in order to soften them for the animals, provided that they will eat them shortly. 1387 (As we have mentioned, the transgression is already incurred when one places the seed in water, even though it will not take root for a few days.) • One may not place an avocado pit in a glass of water so that it will grow roots. 1388 One may place whole fruit into water on Shabbos, as long as he does not pickle them (see Day___). 1389 • One may place apples into water so that they become softer for infants.

246,27/03/2026,ZORE’A: MORE FORMS OF PLANTING,"We have seen that anything that improves the growth of a plant is forbidden under zore’a . We have discussed planting seeds and soaking them. Here are a few more applications. Different Forms of Zore’a Weeding Removing weeds will ultimately improve the other plants, 1390 and therefore constitutes zore’a . 1391 (Doing so also constitutes kotzer [harvesting] — see Days___—225.) Irrigating Pouring anything that will improve the growth of a seed or plant onto the ground constitutes zore’a . 1392 This is why one may not eat a meal on the grass, such as during Sukkos, if irrigation from food, drinks, or water is likely to occur. 1393 • One may not wash his hands over a garden or lawn. See also Day__. 1394 • One may not place fertilizer or any food that will eventually decompose and become fertilizer on a lawn. Irrigating an area that does not currently have any plants but will still benefit from being irrigated still constitutes zore’a . 1395 • One may not pour compost onto a patch of earth that does not currently have anything growing on it, as it will ultimately assist anything that will be planted there in the future. (Note that compost is usually muktzeh , unless it was designated before Shabbos for a permitted use.) It is permitted to pour any liquid that will destroy growth. 1396 However, one should not assume that a particular liquid is not good for growth, as some soaps and detergents actually do help growth. • One may urinate on grass, as it actually prevents growth. 1397 • One may spill strong dry wine into the bushes. However, it is forbidden to pour grape juice, sweet wines, beer, or fruit juices. 1398 Pruning Cutting a branch off a bush or tree usually improves its future growth. Aside from the prohibition of of kotzer (harvesting), doing so is also a transgression of zore’a , as it improves the growth of the bush/tree. • One may not run on long grass where it is almost certain that it will get cut by his footsteps. 1399 This would constitute a Rabbinic prohibition of both kotzer (harvesting) and zore’a (planting).

247,28/03/2026,ZORE’A: PLACING PLANTS IN WATER,"We have seen that anything that improves the growth of plants is forbid- den under zore’a . This can include planting, soaking, weeding, irrigating, and pruning. Flowers Many people place flowers in jars or vases. Detaching flowers from the ground on Shabbos constitutes the prohibition of kotzer . Flowers are some- times muktzeh — only those that were detached and designated for use before Shabbos may be moved. 1400 Flowers That One Is Permitted to Handle The only flowers that must be discussed are those that were detached and designated for use before Shabbos. These flowers fall into one of two categories: Will Grow by Being Placed in Water Regarding zore’a , one is not permitted to place flowers into water if they are capable of opening up or growing (even just budding more leaves) because of it. 1401 This would constitute the Torah prohibition. Will Not Grow by Being Placed in Water If the flowers will not open up or grow more, one may only return them to water. One may not prepare water to place them into for the first time, nor may one change or add to the water. These three acts are Rabbinically forbidden under the category of tirchah yeseirah (extraneous weekday activities). 1402 If one has prepared water before Shabbos but forgot to put the flowers in, he may put them in on Shabbos if they will not open up or grow. 1403 If necessary, one may ask a non-Jew to prepare water and put such flowers in it. 1404 A Lulav on Sukkos During Sukkos (excluding Shabbos that falls out during Sukkos), one may return his lulav, hadassim , or aravos to water, if they need it. 1405 One may even add water, 1406 as it is needed for Sukkos. However, one may not prepare water for the first time, nor may one change the water. However, as we have mentioned, one may not place them in water if they will open or grow further by doing so. It is important to note that on Shabbos that falls out during Sukkos, the lulav may not be handled, as it is muktzeh . 1407",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1400. Mishnah Berurah  336:53.

248,29/03/2026,ZORE’A: POTTED PLANTS,"We have seen that anything that improves the growth of plants is forbidden under zore’a . This includes planting, soaking, weeding, irrigating, and pruning. Potted Plants All of the prohibitions that we have discussed so far apply to potted plants. 1408 • One may not plant a seed in a pot, nor may one water it, prune it, or fertilize it. Note that potted plants are usually muktzeh , and may not be moved on Shab- bos unless one designated it before Shabbos. 1409 If necessary, it may be moved abnormally, but only according to the guidelines set out below. Potted Plants Derive Nutrients from the Ground A potted plant draws nutrients from the ground, and this improves its growth. 1410 This is true even if it has no holes at the bottom of the pot. There- fore, exposing a potted plant to the ground where it had not been exposed until then is forbidden under the melachah of zore’a . 1411 Similarly, removing a potted plant from its exposure to the ground effec- tively detaches it from its place of growth, and is forbidden under the melachah of kotzer (harvesting). (We will discuss this in more detail when we learn the halachos of kotzer .) Some Poskim are stringent even regarding cement and ceramic floors, 1412 as they are made from powdered sand and are considered earth. Tiles made of marble and stone do effectively block the nutrients, as does any metal that is thick enough to prevent roots from breaking through it. Practical Applications The following examples will only apply in cases where the plant is not muk- tzeh , as it has been designated for use from before Shabbos. The house discussed in the example below is assumed to have a marble, stone, or metal paving that will effectively block the plant from the earth. If in doubt, consult a Rav . • It is forbidden to move a potted plant from inside the house to outside, as it will derive nutrients from the earth. Some Poskim are stringent even if one moves the plant to a paved porch. Similarly, these actions are forbidden in reverse. • One may move a potted plant from one room in the house to another. 1413 • One may drag an outdoor potted plant from one place to another, if he does not lift it off the ground, and if it is not heavy enough to cause a deep furrow in the earth. • If a potted plant falls into the house from an outside ledge, one may not return it. Additionally, one may not return the soil to the pot. The pot may also be considered muktzeh . However, if the spilled soil is a nuisance that is disturbing the members of the house, one may move it____ to a place where it may not cause growth, as it is considered a graf shel re’i (see Day___). Standing Under a Hanging Potted Plant If one is standing under a hanging potted plant, he is allowed to move away from it, even though the plant will be able to derive nutrients from the ground. This is because the plant can draw nutrition from the ground around the person. Placing Plants in the Sun or Shade Plants benefit from being in the sun. Moving a plant into the sun is forbid- den, as it helps it grow. Similarly, one may not move a plant that is in the sun into the shade. Opening and Closing Curtains and Windows One may open or close a curtain in order to add or remove sunlight from a room. In such a case, one’s intention must be for the sun or shade, not to cause the plants to grow. 1415 Preventing Damage Although actively improving a plant is prohibited, doing a non- melachah act that will prevent the plant from being damaged is permitted. • One may prevent animals from eating plants. 1416 Doing so does not constitute zore’a .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1408. Nishmas Adam  2:11:1 and  Aruch HaShulchan  336:30 state that even potted plants with  no holes carry a Torah prohibition. However, the  Shevet HaLevi  7:97:3 states that a pot without  holes carries a Rabbinic prohibition.

249,30/03/2026,ZORE’A: SPRINKLER SYSTEMS;   WASHING IN A PLACE THAT WILL  CAUSE IRRIGATION,"We have seen that anything that improves the growth of plants is forbidden under zore’a . This includes planting, soaking, weeding, irrigating, and pruning. The prohibition also applies to potted plants and cut flowers. Turning On a Sprinkler or Garden Hose Before Shabbos One may turn on a sprinkler or garden hose before Shabbos even though it will irrigate the garden on Shabbos. 1417 One may also shut a manual sprinkler or hose on Shabbos, as there is no melachah involved in the act of closing, nor in stopping the irrigation. 1418 But if the tap is connected to an electronic sprinkler system and will affect the settings on it, one may not shut the tap. Setting a Sprinkler System on a Timer Today, most people are lenient regarding the use of timers on Shabbos. Thus, one may set a sprinkler system to go on and off on Shabbos. 1419 Water That Will Indirectly Flow to a Garden Although watering a garden is a Torah prohibition, if the water will only flow to the garden indirectly, such as via a pipe or some other surface, one may open a faucet, as long as he does so for a permitted purpose. 1420 But he may not do so with intention of watering the garden. • One may wash a tiled or paved porch with water to get rid of dirt or animal droppings, provided that the water will take time to reach the garden situated at the edge of the tiled surface — but he must not do so with intention to water the garden. However, if the water drips directly onto the garden from the porch, it is forbidden. • One may not drink from a water fountain if some water will certainly drip onto plants or grass. But if the water that drips will only reach the plants or grass after traveling via a paved surface or a pipe, one may drink from it — but he must not do so with intention to water the plants or grass. 1421 Sukkah Covers After Rainfall Once a garden is already significantly wet — such as after a major down- pour — one may pour water onto it, as long as his intention is not to water it. Therefore, one may remove a sukkah cover after a downpour even though the water that has accumulated will fall onto the wet garden, as long as he does so in order to use the sukkah, and the garden is already saturated with rainwater. 1422",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1417.

250,31/03/2026,ZORE’A: NON-JEWISH GARDENERS,"We have seen that anything that improves the growth of plants is forbidden under zore’a . This includes planting, soaking, weeding, irrigating, and pruning. The prohibition also applies to potted plants and cut flowers. We have also discussed garden hoses and sprinklers. Non-Jewish Gardeners The halachos regarding benefiting from melachos performed by non-Jews on Shabbos are complex (see Days___—384). In general, a Jew may not benefit from a melachah done for him by a non-Jew, whether or not the non- Jew was asked to do it. 1423 Furthermore, a Jew may not ask a non-Jew to do a melachah . 1424 • A Jew must not ask his non-Jewish gardener to irrigate the Jew’s garden on Shabbos. Moreover, he must prevent a non-Jewish gardener from watering it. Gardeners: Why Normal Leniencies Do Not Apply Generally, one may ask a non-Jew to do work before Shabbos, provided that: a. One does not specify that the work must be done on Shabbos; b. It does not appear to an onlooker that it is for the Jew’s benefit; and c. One does not pay him by the hour, but rather a fixed fee for the completion of the job. 1425 However, this leniency does not apply if the melachah is being done on the property of a Jew, because it is obvious that it is done for the Jew’s benefit. 1426 • A gardening service or non-Jewish gardener may not attend to a Jew’s garden on Shabbos, even if he negotiated with them before Shabbos to water the garden any time during the week for a fixed monthly fee. This is because it is on the Jew’s property. Moreover, there is generally a leniency if the non-Jew is capable of doing the same job without doing any melachos (see Days___ and___). 1427 This is why cleaning ladies may wash dishes on Shabbos even if they use hot water, as they (theoretically) can use cold water instead of hot water (avoiding bishul [cooking]). However, if the job can only be done via a melachah , one must prevent them from doing it. • Because there is no way to irrigate a garden without transgressing a melachah , one must prevent his non-Jewish gardener from watering the garden on Shabbos. 1428",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1423.

251,01/04/2026,CHORESH (PLOWING),"Introduction One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan is choresh (plowing) — preparing the ground for planting. 1429 When Choresh Applies The melachah of choresh is applicable to any place that something is currently or could be growing. This includes potted plants and any area that is theoretically available for planting. Therefore, it does not apply to tiled, carpeted, or paved floors. (Fixing these is still prohibited under boneh .) Practical Applications Dragging a Table or Chair One may not drag a table or chair on soft earth or grass in a place where it will certainly make a furrow, an act of plowing. 1430 However, if it is not cer- tain that it will make a furrow, and one would not need it if it was made, it is permitted. Filling Holes and Leveling a Surface One may not fill up holes or flatten soil or a grass surface, because doing so is part of preparing for planting. 1431 (Doing so in the house is included in the prohibition of boneh .) Improving a Garden One may not plow soil or remove weeds or thorns on Shabbos. 1432 Fur- thermore, one may not remove sticks or stones from the ground, thus making it available for planting. One may not fertilize an area or dig a hole, 1433 as both prepare the ground for planting seeds or plants. In short, anything that prepares an area for planting is forbidden.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1429. It is a dispute as to what constitutes the actual  melachah . Rashi holds that it is softening the  earth ( Shabbos  73b;  Moed Katan  2b). The Rambam holds that it is preparing the earth for planting.

252,02/04/2026,CHORESH: SOIL AND SAND,"We have seen that any act done to make an area available for planting is forbidden under choresh . Making a Hole in Normal Soil Digging a hole or sticking an object into any accumulated sand or soil, whether it is on the ground or in a vessel, constitutes choresh . 1434 However, one may remove an object from sand, even if it will leave behind a hole. This is be- cause the hole was already in existence. • One may not stick a knife into the soil of a potted plant since it will make a hole — an act that is considered choresh . However, one may remove a knife that was stuck in it previously. • One may not sit on a bench or place a table on the ground if the legs are thin enough to certainly make a hole in the soil. 1435 However, one may do so if the legs are wide and flat, as it will not create a hole. In either case, one may remove the bench or table. • One may not rub phlegm into soil if rubbing it in will obviously create a hole. Extremely Fine Sand and Sandboxes If the soil is so fine that it immediately fills up any hole that is made, one may dig there. This is because digging in such a place never actually creates a hole. One can be lenient and allow children to play in a dry sandbox____ if the sand is light and fine, 1437 so that any holes dug will automatically be filled by the sand falling from the sides. Other Issues Regarding Sand Sand that was not prepared before Shabbos is muktzeh , and may not be handled. One may not play with sand on the beach on Shabbos. Furthermore, it is forbidden to break clumps of sand, as it is tochen (see Days___ and___). 1438 One may not pour cement powder or sand into water on Shabbos, as it is lash (see Day___). 1439",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1434.

253,03/04/2026,CHORESH: STROLLERS,"We have seen that any act that prepares the ground for planting is forbidden under choresh . This includes digging a hole in which a seed could theoretically be planted in soil. However, it is not considered choresh if the hole is caused by pressure ap- plied to it (not by digging), provided that one’s intention is not to prepare the ground for use. 1440 This leniency applies to several everyday actions. Walking on Sand One may walk on soft sand even though he will cause a deep footprint while doing so, as long as making the hole is not his intention. This is because the hole is produced using pressure, not using a digging action. Pushing a Stroller or Wheelchair In a place where there is an eiruv (or on Yom Tov), one may push a stroller or wheelchair through soft soil even though it causes a furrow along the way. This is because the hole is created by compressing the soil, not by digging in the soil. 1441 One may even steer the stroller or wheelchair to the side, even though a furrow will be created. 1442 But one must not do so for the purpose of making a hole. It also should be noted that one should not push a stroller or wheelchair over plants and flowers that will definitely become detached as he pushes. 1443 This is prohibited under the melachah of kotzer (harvesting).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1440.

Detached Branches As we have explained, kotzer only applies when the fruit or vegetable is at- tached to its place of growth. Once the branch has been detached, it is permitted to pick the fruit from the branch. 1448 However, one must designate that branch for use before Shabbos to avoid it being prohibited due to muktzeh . • If one broke off a branch full of lemons before Shabbos in order to use them on Shabbos, he may pick them off of the branch.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1444.

255,05/04/2026,KOTZER: POTTED PLANTS;   MUSHROOMS;  FLOWERS,"We have seen that detaching something from its place of growth constitutes the melachah of kotzer . Potted Plants The laws of planting and harvesting apply to potted plants in the same way that they apply to things that grow in the ground (see Day___). 1449 • Detaching a plant, leaf, or flower from a potted plant constitutes kotzer . 1450 • Because the ground gives nutrients to a potted plant, one may not re- move a potted plant from a place where it is exposed to the ground. Mushrooms and Algae Although mushrooms and algae do not have roots, they are still con- sidered things that grow. 1451 Removing them from their source of growth constitutes kotzer . Playing on Grass Playing athletic games on grass is likely to cause the grass to become de- tached, and is thus prohibited (see Day__ for more details). However, if it is unlikely that the grass will become detached, it is permitted. (See Day___ for other issues related to playing with balls on Shabbos.) One is permitted to walk or sit on grass. Flowers in a Vase One may remove flowers from a vase, provided that they have not taken root there. 1452 As we have mentioned, one may not replace them in water if they will open or grow, and even if they are fully grown, one may only return them to the same water.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1449.

256,06/04/2026,KOTZER: SMELLING FRUITS AND  FLOWERS;  RIDING ON ANIMALS,"Until now, we have discussed the Torah prohibition of kotzer . In their great wisdom, Chazal added additional prohibitions in order to safeguard Shabbos from being desecrated. Smelling Flowers or Fruit One may not smell a fruit that is still attached to a tree, as he may come to pluck it, transgressing the Torah prohibition. 1453 However, this only applies to fruits or plants that are edible. One is permitted to smell flowers or herbs that are still growing, as he need not pick them to benefit from them. 1454 • One may not smell an apple on a tree. • One may smell rosemary that is still growing on a bush (one should say the brachah of Borei Isvei Besamim____ ). • One may smell myrtle branches that are still growing on a tree (one should say the brachah of Borei Atzei Besamim ). Riding on Animals It is forbidden to ride animals on Shabbos, 1456 lest one come to break off a stick from a tree (a Torah prohibition) in order to use it to hurry the animal. 1457 Chazal included all types of direct usage of animals in this decree, 1458 even if it is not an animal that is rideable, and even if there are no trees around. • One may not ride a horse or an elephant on Shabbos. • One may not place a child on an animal on Shabbos. • One may not rest his arm on an animal. • One may not board a horse-drawn wagon on Shabbos, even if it is being driven by a non-Jew. 1459 Removing a Load from an Animal One may remove a load from an animal on Shabbos if the load is distressing the animal. If the items on the animal are muktzeh , one may only remove them in an abnormal way, if possible, such as using his back to lower them instead of his hand. 1460 (If the items may break, he should put cushions there to ensure that they do not.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1453.

257,07/04/2026,KOTZER: USING A TREE —  DIRECT USAGE,"We have seen that Chazal , in their great wisdom, prohibited smelling fruit and riding animals, in order to safeguard Shabbos from being desecrated. They also decreed that using trees is forbidden, lest one come to break a branch, which constitutes the Torah prohibition of kotzer . All types of usage are prohibited. 1461 In addition, anything directly connected to a tree on Shabbos is considered muktzeh , and may not be handled. The various forms of prohibited usage of a tree are explained below. DEFINING THE PROHIBITION The prohibition applies even if the tree is dry, and even if it has no branch- es or fruit. 1462 However, if it less than_ tefachim (9.45 inches/24 centimeters) high, 1463 one may use it or sit on it. 1464 • One may not climb or sit on a tree, even if it is dry or does not have branches. However, one may climb or sit on the roots of trees or branch- es that are within_.45 inches (or__ centimeters) of the ground. • One may sit on the trunk of a tree if it is less than_.45 inches (or__ centimeters) high. 1465 Climbing One may not climb a tree on Shabbos. If one climbed a tree on Shabbos knowingly and intentionally, Chazal penalized him and forbade him to descend. However, if he went up unknowingly or unintentionally, he must descend. 1466 Placing onto or Removing from a Tree One may not place anything into or on a tree, because that is considered direct usage. 1467 Similarly, one may not remove something that is in or on a tree. • One may not tie an animal to a tree. 1468 • One may not hang a jacket on a tree. If one did so, he may not remove it. • If a ball or a garment got stuck in a tree, one may not remove it. 1469 Placing Things in a Tree Before Shabbos One may not place day-to-day items into a tree before Shabbos, as removing them is forbidden on Shabbos. 1470 If an item falls off by itself, it is muktzeh and may not be moved. 1471 • One should not hang his hat or jacket on a tree before Shabbos. If one’s hat or jacket was in a tree from before Shabbos, he may not remove it on Shabbos. If it fell, it is muktzeh and may not be moved. Resting and Leaning on a Tree Leaning on a tree in a way that one would not lose balance if it was removed is not considered benefiting from the tree, and one is permitted to do so. 1472 However, one may not sit or lie on a tree. One may certainly not lean on or even touch a tree (or branch) if it will move. One is, however, allowed to touch a tree if it will not move as a result. 1473 It follows that a weak person may not lean on a tree at all, as that is consid- ered full usage of a tree, which is forbidden, even if the tree will not move. 1474",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1461.

258,08/04/2026,KOTZER: USING A TREE —  INDIRECT USAGE,"We have seen that direct usage of trees is Rabbinically forbidden on Shabbos. This includes climbing, leaning heavily, and using a tree to hang or store objects. When it comes to indirect usage, the halachah depends on how the tree is being used. Using something that is connected to a tree (one step removed) is also prohibited. However, using something that is two steps removed is permit- ted, 1475 unless the tree will move as a result. We will now discuss several practical applications. Jackets Hanging on Trees____ One may not hang a jacket on a tree on Shabbos (and even before Shabbos), as that is directly using the tree. Furthermore, even if the jacket was somehow left on the tree before Shabbos, one may not place anything into the jacket’s pockets or remove anything from them, because it is only one step removed from the tree. However, a jacket that is hanging on a nail that was hammered into a tree (before Shabbos) is two steps removed from the tree, so one may use the jacket as he wishes. One must be sure not to cause the tree to move when doing so. Ladders Leaning against Trees One may not lean a ladder on a tree on Shabbos, because that is directly using the tree. Furthermore, even if the ladder was leaning on the tree before Shabbos, one may not climb the ladder, as it is only one step removed from the tree. 1477 However, if it is leaning on a peg or nail that is connected to the tree (from before Shabbos), the ladder is two steps removed, so one may climb on it — but not onto the tree itself. One must also be sure not to cause the tree to move when doing so. Swings or Hammocks That Are Attached to Trees One may not tie a rope around a tree on Shabbos, as that is directly using the tree. Tying knots is also forbidden under kosher (tying). Furthermore, even if the rope was tied around the tree before Shabbos, one may not hang anything on it. If a tire or swing is connected to a rope that is tied around a tree, one may not swing on it, as the rope is only one step removed. Furthermore, the tree is muktzeh , and if lying or swinging will move it, it is forbidden. If one wishes to have a swing, hammock, chair, or the like available to use on Shabbos, he may drill screws or bolts into the tree, and loop or tie the rope onto them before Shabbos. In that way, the rope is two steps removed, and the tire, swing, hammock, or chair may be used. In summary, using a tree directly or one step removed is prohibited. One may use an item that is two steps removed from the tree provided the tree will not move.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1475. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  336:13.

259,09/04/2026,KOTZER: OTHER PRACTICAL  APPLICATIONS,"Fruit That Fell from a Tree____ One may not eat any fruit that fell from a tree on Shabbos, even if it fell by itself. Chazal were concerned that one may come to actively pick fruit. 1479 In fact, even if one does not know if the fruit fell on Shabbos, he may not eat it, and the fruit is muktzeh . 1480 Fruit that definitely fell before Shabbos is permitted. Removing a Fish from Water According to some opinions, removing a fish from water is considered detaching something from its place of growth, and is therefore forbidden. 1481 Additionally, removing a fish to die constitutes the melachah of shochet (slaugh- tering) — see Days___ and___. However, even if one removes a fish from water with the intention to place it back in the water afterwards, it is still forbidden under kotzer . Detaching Skin According to most opinions, detaching skin that is still growing is forbidden under the melachah of gozez (shearing). However, some Poskim say that it con- stitutes kotzer , as one is detaching something from its place of growth.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1478. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  322:3.

260,10/04/2026,ME’AMER (GATHERING),"Introduction We have discussed the three primary agricultural acts prohibited by the Torah on Shabbos: planting, plowing or preparing the ground, and harvesting or detaching, as well as their related Rabbinic decrees. The final act involved in getting the produce into the storehouse is me’amer — gathering up the produce into piles. The Torah Prohibition One may not gather produce in the place where it grew. 1482 Gathering two or more items is forbidden, but picking up one item (if it was detached before Shabbos) is permitted. Produce that fell on Shabbos is prohibited to be handled since it is muktzeh (see Day___). The Torah prohibition only applies to things that grow from the ground. However, see below regarding Rabbinic prohibitions. Fruit Trees One may not gather fruits that have fallen from a tree and are lying near it, even if they fell before Shabbos. 1483 However, one may pick up one fruit if it definitely fell before Shabbos. Flowers and Plants One may not gather flowers where they fell or were cut, even if they were detached before Shabbos. However, one may pick up a single rose that definitely fell before Shabbos. The Rabbinic Prohibition Chazal also applied the prohibition to things that do not grow from the ground, if they are still in their place of origin. 1484 Fresh Eggs____ According to some Poskim , one may not gather eggs that were laid in the coop before Shabbos, even though they do not grow from the ground. However, one may take one egg if it was definitely laid before Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1482. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  340:9;  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  26:24.

261,11/04/2026,ME’AMER: FRUITS AND VEGETABLES  IN THE HOUSE,"We have seen that it is a Torah prohibition to gather fruits and vegetables where they grew, and a Rabbinic prohibition to gather things that do not grow from the ground, in their place of origin. Another Rabbinic Prohibition Chazal also decreed that one may not gather produce even away from their place of growth. 1486 However, three leniencies apply: 1. One may gather them one by one and eat them as he picks them up, provided that he does not place them in a container or box as usual. 1487_. One may pick them up once they have already been gathered or taken to one place. 1488_. This Rabbinic prohibition only applies to things that grow from the ground, and have not been processed since being detached from the ground. 1489 Practical Applications Spilled Oranges If a bag of oranges fell and spread out throughout the kitchen, one may not gather them into a container or bag. Rather, he may pick up each one separately and eat it, or place it on a table. Once they have been placed on a table, he may then put them into a container or bag. Alternatively, one may sweep them all to one place (preferably with a broom that has been designated only for Shabbos use____ ), and then pick them up nor- mally and place them in a container or bag. 1491 Additionally, if they all fell in one place, one may pick them up from the floor. It must be noted that if the oranges fell into dirt or sand, one may only pick them up one at a time, and only to eat them immediately — and he must also be careful not to transgress borer . 1492 Candies That Were Thrown at an Aufruf Candy does not grow from the ground and is already processed. Therefore, there is no Rabbinic prohibition on gathering them. One may gather them and place them into containers as he wishes (being sure not to transgress borer [selecting]). Messy Rooms Clothes do not grow from the ground, but certainly have been processed, as well as having been moved from their place of origin. Therefore, there is no Rabbinic prohibition on gathering them. One may gather them and put them away as he wishes (being sure not do transgress borer [selecting] [see Day___].) Paper Although paper comes from trees, it has undergone processing since then. Therefore, if a stack of papers have blown all over a room, one may gather them into a box or file. However, he must be certain not to transgress borer . Moreover, many types of important papers may be muktzeh on Shabbos, and may not be handled in the normal way (see Day___).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1485.

262,12/04/2026,TZAD (TRAPPING),"Introduction Trapping animals for their skin was one of the necessary acts for building the Mishkan. Although this seems far removed from today’s modern world, there are actually many practical applications, such as: • Trapping a bee in a cup • Locking pets away Types of Creatures Trapping any creature is prohibited. 1493 However, there are two levels of prohibition: 1494 The Torah Prohibition An animal that is usually trapped for its skin, meat, or some other product such as poison constitutes the Torah prohibition. • Trapping deer, chickens, birds, and fish is a Torah prohibition, as they are caught to be eaten. • Trapping snakes and scorpions also falls under the Torah prohibition, 1495 as they are caught for the use of their venom. • Trapping horses for use in transportation is a Torah prohibition. The Rabbinic Prohibition Trapping an animal that is not usually trapped for use in some way, but rather to remove it from the open, constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Trapping wasps and flies fall into this category. • It is a Rabbinic prohibition to close the lid of a shoebox if a fly is in it. 1496 • It is a Rabbinic prohibition to close the netting of a window so that a fly is trapped. It is important to know that one may not even trap an animal momentarily, even if he will let it go free soon afterwards. 1497",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1493.

263,13/04/2026,TZAD: THE METHOD OF TRAPPING,"We have seen that trapping any animal is prohibited. The Torah prohibition applies to trapping those animals that are usually trapped for a purpose, and the Rabbinic prohibition applies to trapping those animals that are not usually trapped for a purpose. It makes no difference how one traps — all forms of trapping are forbidden. • One may not set up a mouse trap____ or bird net on Shabbos. • One may not trap a mosquito using his hands. • One may not trap a wild bird, dog, or cat by closing a door or window____ or blocking an exit. 1500 • One may not a trap a stray hamster by closing a cage door. One may set up a trap before Shabbos. 1501 • One may put out a mousetrap, fly catcher, or bee cage before Shabbos. We will explore leniencies and situations in which trapping may be permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1498. Mishnah Berurah  316:18.

1501. Shabbos  17b."
264,14/04/2026,TZAD: DEFINING “TRAPPED”,"In order to be considered trapped on a Torah level, the animal must be re- stricted to a place where it has no way out, otherwise defined as “a place where it can be grabbed easily.” 1502 However, restricting the animal to a confined area that still requires a small measure of effort to capture it in one’s hand still constitutes a Rabbinic prohi- bition. Practical Examples Wild Birds If a wild bird flew into an outdoor birdcage, closing the cage door constitutes the Torah prohibition, as it is now trapped. 1503 However, closing the doors and windows of a large room where a wild bird is located still constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, as a small measure of effort will still be required to capture it. 1504 Fish Scooping a fish into a bucket while it is inside a river or pond constitutes the Torah prohibition, as it is then quite easy to catch. 1505 However, moving a fish from a river or ocean to a small pond constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, as some effort will still be necessary to capture it. (Note that there are other transgressions associated with taking a fish out of water — it may be kotzer , the Torah prohibition of removing a living thing from its source. Moving animals is also prohibited under muktzeh . Also, removing the fish from the water with no intention of placing it back in water, ultimately causing its death, constitutes the Torah prohibition of shochet [slaughtering].) CONFINING AN ANIMAL THAT IS ALREADY TRAPPED Once an animal is considered fully trapped (that is, it is in a confined space and requiring little or no effort to grab hold of it), one may confine it further within that space. 1506 • Once a bird is already in a closed cage, one may close a partition within the cage, even though it will confine it further. • Once a fish is already in a bucket, one may pour the contents of the bucket into another bucket, all at once.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1502.

265,15/04/2026,TZAD: PETS,"Until this point, we have only discussed those animals that are not subser- vient to a human master. Pets can fall into three Halachic categories. Pets That Always Run Away When Called____ Trapping a pet that always runs out and will not come back unless it is physically brought back carries the Torah prohibition of tzad . This is particularly relevant with new pets. • If one has a new or disobedient dog that has not been taught to stay inside, locking it inside is a Torah prohibition. • One may not trap chickens or rabbits that are not yet familiar with their owners. 1508 Pets That Return When They Want To____ Trapping a pet that sometimes rebels, but will eventually come back to its master, carries a Rabbinic prohibition of tzad . • One may not close a hamster cage if the hamster would not ordinarily return to the cage by itself. This is true even if the hamster is in a closed- off garden or room, assuming it would still take some effort to catch it. This is particularly relevant when feeding the hamster. As one opens the cage to put food inside, it is no longer trapped, and subsequently closing the cage door would be considered trapping. The solution is to block the opening while feeding the hamster, so that it will remain trapped throughout. 1510 If an animal of this category will get hurt or lost by remaining outside, or is dangerous to strangers, one may ask a non-Jew to bring it back inside. If one’s young children bring the animal back on their own volition, he need not prevent them from doing so, but he may not instruct them to bring the animal back. 1511 This leniency does not apply to those animals that run away when called (the Torah-prohibited category above). • One may ask a non-Jew to bring back a dog that always runs out of the driveway gate, and has not yet been trained not to bite strangers. • One may ask a non-Jew to capture a hamster that has gotten into the closed garden if he is afraid that it may get hurt or be eaten by a local cat. Pets That Always Listen and Large Animals That Do Not Run____ An obedient pet that listens to its master is already considered trapped. Therefore, no prohibition applies to trapping it. The same applies to animals that are not accustomed to running at all. • An old pet dog usually comes to its master when called. Thus, one may lock it in. • A pet horse or cow does not usually run away. Thus, one may lock it in. However, if a particular animal does not obey the command of its owner, it is forbidden.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1507. Mishnah Berurah  316:59.

266,16/04/2026,"TZAD: TOUCHING, MOVING, AND  TREATING PETS","We mentioned that one may only trap a pet if it is very obedient or is easily caught. We will now discuss a few more issues that apply to pets. Moving Animals Animals are muktzeh . 1513 Therefore, even when it is permitted to trap a pet (see Day___), one should not move the animal physically. 1514 Rather, he can chase it into the cage or house and close the door. One is allowed to move an animal in order to protect it from harm or in order to prevent a loss. 1515 Touching an Animal One may pat a pet provided that he does not actually move the body of the animal. 1516 Removing Fish Although fish are also muktzeh , one may remove a dead fish from a tank to prevent the other fish from dying, if not doing so will cause a major loss. 1517 This is a leniency to prevent harm to the other animals. However, if one’s concern is that due to the proliferation of the fish, the big fish will eat up the small fish, one may not remove them, as this is normal behavior for fish. One may, however, ask a non-Jew to do so. 1518 According to some Poskim , one may not move a fish tank, since the fish and the water themselves are muktzeh . 1519 A Fish That Jumped Out of Its Tank According to some Poskim , one may put back a fish that jumped out of the water. 1520 Moving Birdcages As we have mentioned, a bird is muktzeh . According to some Poskim , moving a birdcage is forbidden. 1521 If the cage is in the sun or other light and the bird needs to be in the dark, it is best that one cover the cage with a cloth that blocks out the light. 1522 How- ever, if there is no other option, he may move the cage. This is to prevent harm to the bird. Feeding Animals One may feed any animal that is starving, based on the verse “He is merciful towards all of His creatures.” 1523 One may feed any animal that is his own responsibility. One may feed any dog, even if it is not his responsibility. 1524",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1512. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  27:35.

267,17/04/2026,TZAD: ANIMALS THAT HARM OR  IRRITATE,"We have seen that trapping an animal is prohibited, and that the Torah pro- hibition applies to trapping those animals that are usually trapped for a purpose, and the Rabbinic prohibition applies to trapping those animals that are not usually trapped for a purpose. A Life-Threatening Animal Obviously, one must do anything to save a Jewish life. One is required to trap or kill any animal that presents a threat to the life of a Jew. 1525 Trapping to Avoid Harm One may also trap any animal to prevent harm. This applies even if it is not lethal. • If a snake is likely to bite, 1526 even if it is not venomous, one may trap it. 1527 One may not kill it unless it could pose a danger to life, or he is not capable of trapping it. 1528 • If a scorpion, spider, or wasp is lurking and may hurt someone, one may trap it by putting a vessel on top of it. 1529 Obviously, if one suspects but is not certain if the animal in question is life-threatening, he may do anything necessary to stop it, including trapping or killing it. Trapping to Avoid Irritation If one wishes to get rid of an irritating animal or biting insect that is on his body, he should preferably avoid trapping it. If that is not possible, he may only trap an animal that one is Rabbinically prohibited to trap (that is, it is not com- monly trapped for use) and he should release it immediately. 1530 • One may trap a mosquito, bee, or irritating fly (if he cannot otherwise get rid of it), 1531 but he may not kill it. If one is allergic, one may even be permitted to kill the insect — see Day___.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1525. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  316:10.

268,18/04/2026,TZAD: MORE PRACTICAL  APPLICATIONS,"Here are a few more scenarios where the prohibition of tzad may apply: Sleeping, Blind, Old, and Sick Animals Tzad still applies to trapping an animal that is sleeping or sick, as it would no doubt want to escape if it could. 1532 Therefore, one may not trap a dog or bird that is hurt. (Furthermore, it is muktzeh .) Closing a Window on a Cold Day If a bird or fly is in a large room, where it will still require some effort to catch, 1533 and one wishes to close the window or door because it is cold, he may do so. However, if his intention is to trap the animal, it is prohibited. 1534 An Extremely Large Room Some Poskim write that if a bird is in an enormous room, so that it is hardly noticeable that the bird is there, one may close the windows or doors, 1535 if necessary. Releasing an Animal One may release a trapped animal. If one has erroneously trapped an animal on Shabbos, he should free it, so that he derives no benefit from it. However, he still must repent for his actions. 1536 Putting a Lid on Flies If one sees that flies have infested his food, he may not trap them inside (to protect the rest of the food from being affected). However, if there is a gap in the cover through which they could escape, he may cover the food. 1537",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1532. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  316:2.

269,19/04/2026,SHOCHET (SLAUGHTERING),"Introduction One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan was killing ani- mals. Therefore, it constitutes a Torah prohibition to kill a live being on Shabbos, even if it is dying. 1538 Blood is considered life, and therefore, bruising (causing blood to be drawn under the skin) or wounding a live being is included in the prohibition. 1539 The Torah prohibition is transgressed when one kills or bruises for a specific purpose, such as if he needs the dead animal or its blood, or he needs to let out his aggression. If one does not do so for a purpose, it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. • One may not kill a fly. • One may not play-fight____ and cause____ a bruise. 1542 • One may not scratch a scab, as it will cause bleeding. 1543 • One may not remove a fish from water. 1544 The Manner of Killing or Bruising The manner in which one kills or bruises the animal or person is irrelevant. • One may not flush an insect down a toilet or turn on a faucet when an insect is in the sink if it is certain to die. 1545 • One may not spray ants with insecticide.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1538.

270,20/04/2026,SHOCHET: DANGEROUS OR  HARMFUL ANIMALS,"We have seen that it is forbidden to kill or bruise any living being. We will now discuss cases in which there is danger to life or a possibility of harm. Life-Threatening Animals or People As mentioned previously, if there is any possible threat to life, one must go to any lengths to prevent it, 1546 even killing animals if necessary. 1547 Those animals that are inherently dangerous may be killed even if they are not currently causing harm, and even if they are running away. 1548 This also applies to cases where a person is dangerously allergic to an animal that is not life-threatening to most people. • If a person is extremely allergic to bees, one must kill any bees that are in his vicinity. 1549 Harmful Animals or People If the animal (or person) is not life-threatening but may still cause harm, one may kill it only if it is approaching or attacking with intent to harm. • One may kill a nonlethal snake that is approaching. (If one is not certain if it is life-threatening, he may kill it even if it is not approaching.) If it is not approaching or attacking, it is better to trap it. If that is not possi- ble, 1550 one may kill it only in the course of his normal activity, but he may not kill it outright. • If a nonlethal snake is in a person’s vicinity, he should try to put a vessel on top of it so that it will be unable to escape. If that is not possible, he may step on it while walking, in a way that it does not appear to the onlooker that he went out of his way to kill it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1546.

271,21/04/2026,SHOCHET: EVERYDAY APPLICATIONS,"We have seen that it is forbidden to kill, bruise, or cause blood to be drawn in any living being. Washing Lettuce Leaves Eating an insect constitutes several Torah prohibitions, whether it is dead or alive. Thus, one must check lettuce and/or wash it before eating. One may place the lettuce under the faucet to wash off dead insects. But if there are live insects on the lettuce and doing so will certainly kill them, it is forbidden. 1551 Note that the appropriate methods of checking for bugs may depend on the type of vegetable and the place it is sourced from. Walking Where There Are Ants If one knows that there are ants that will definitely be killed as he walks, he must find a different route. 1552 Similarly, one should not pour water on a floor that has ants on it, since they will certainly be killed as a result. However, if one does not know for certain that there are ants on the path that he is taking, he may continue walking. 1553 Picking Chapped Skin or Lips One may not pick any skin off if it will cause blood to emerge. (Removing skin also constitutes gozez [shearing].) Band-Aids and Ointment One may change a Band-Aid or bandage his wound if it is getting infected or messy. However, he should not squeeze out extra blood. 1554 One may not put on any ointment that draws out blood. When cleaning a wound, one should gently rub it with water, being sure not to draw blood. Removing a Band-Aid may involve a problem of removing hairs. For solu- tions, see Day___. Removing Splinters One may not remove a splinter using a needle if it will cause blood to be drawn. 1555 However, if one is in pain, he may remove the splinter gently, making sure not to draw blood unnecessarily. 1556 It is better to ask a non-Jew to do so. Popping Blisters or Pimples It is forbidden to pop a blister or pimple in order to air it out, as this is a medical procedure that doctors often perform to treat these ailments. 1557 However, if one pops a painful blister or pimple to release the pressure, it is permitted, as long as he does not squeeze out blood from beneath the skin. That is, one may only gently release the pressure, but may not squeeze out any blood that is below the surface from under it. 1558 This is permitted only if the blister or pimple is sore.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1551. Regarding removing dead insects from the leaves, Rav Moshe Sternbuch told me that  there is no problem of  borer .

272,22/04/2026,SHOCHET: BRUSHING TEETH,"We have seen that one may not kill or cause blood to be drawn in any living being. Brushing Teeth Brushing teeth presents a few Halachic concerns. It is best to brush one’s teeth before Shabbos and use mouthwash on Shabbos. We will now discuss the various issues involved with brushing teeth on Shabbos. Shochet As we have seen, drawing blood is forbidden. If a person brushes his teeth daily, it is unlikely that brushing will cause bleeding, and so, shochet will not present an issue. However, anyone for whom it is likely that bleeding will occur may not brush his teeth on Shabbos (even without toothpaste). Sechitah Squeezing is generally prohibited under dash (extracting). Still, some Poskim permit a using a toothbrush, as the bristles are synthetic and spread out far apart from each other, and nothing is truly absorbed in the bristles. 1559 Howev- er, other Poskim are stringent, and also forbid wetting the brush before or after brushing. 1560 Memare’ach Spreading and smoothing a substance is generally prohibited under me- machek or memare’ach (smoothing). 1561 However, some Poskim are lenient in this case, as the toothpaste remains soft. 1562 However, most Poskim are stringent. 1563 In summary, one is advised not to brush his teeth on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1559.

273,23/04/2026,SHOCHET: DENTAL FLOSS;  LICE;  NOSEBLEED;  CHECKING BLOOD  SUGAR OR BLOOD COUNT;   INJECTIONS,"We have seen that one may not kill or cause any blood to be drawn in any living being. Dental Floss If a person does not floss regularly, it is likely that any flossing will cause him to bleed. Flossing is forbidden for such a person. Furthermore, even if a person flosses regularly, if he usually bleeds when doing so, it is forbidden for him to floss on Shabbos. Note that even when it is permitted to floss (that is, one does not usually bleed), the dental floss must be cut before Shabbos. If it was not cut before Shabbos, one may use it on the roll, and wait until after Shabbos to cut it. 1564 Lice One may spray hair in order to kill lice. 1565 However, he may not remove lice from hair using his hand on Shabbos, lest he come to remove a hair. 1566 One may rinse the hair in cold water, but may not rub it down forcefully with a towel — only gently, 1567 being careful not to squeeze lest he transgress the prohibition of sechitah (squeezing). Regarding asking a non-Jew to comb the hair, see Day___. A Bleeding Nose Squeezing the top of the nose in order to stop the bleeding is permitted, as it does not draw any new blood; rather, it stops the current flow. Unless one has no other option, he may not stick anything up the nose. 1568 Checking Blood Sugar or Blood Count One who must check his blood-sugar levels or blood count should attempt to avoid doing so on Shabbos. If at all possible, he should do so before and after Shabbos. However, if he has been instructed by a doctor to do so on Shabbos, he should refer to a Rav . Blood Tests If the person is in danger, one must do anything necessary in order to save his life. 1569 If the person is not in danger, but is unwell, a non-Jew can draw the blood____ or administer injections. 1571",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1564.

274,24/04/2026,GOZEZ (SHEARING),"One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan is gozez (shearing). 1572 The Melachah A person may not shear hair or skin from a person or animal, whether it is dead or alive. 1573 Although shearing any size hair is Rabbinically forbidden, the Torah prohibition is only incurred if the length of the hair is_.3 inches/16 centimeters (2 tefachim ) according to Rashi, or__.6 inches/32 centimeters (4 tefachim ) according to the Rambam. 1574 • One may not brush a dog on Shabbos, as hairs are always drawn from the dog when doing so. • One may not pull hair from a genuine fur coat (as opposed to loose fur that was subsequently attached to form a garment) on Shabbos. Cutting Fingernails One may not cut nails on Shabbos. Using a nail clipper to do so constitutes the Torah prohibition, and using one’s fingers or teeth constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition because that is not the normal way to cut them. 1575 If most of the nail is already off and the hangnail is causing discomfort, one may remove it with his hand, but not with a nail clipper. 1576 A woman who needs to go to the mikvah and forgot to cut her nails before Shabbos should ask a non-Jew to cut them by hand. 1577 If this is not possible, she should consult a Rav . It is worth mentioning that there may be a difference in practical solutions between one’s fingernails and toenails. 1578 Removing Skin Removing a piece of skin that is still attached constitutes the Torah prohi- bition, even if one uses his hands. 1579 • One may not remove skin that is dangling by the edge of his fingers. 1580 Removing Skin, Warts, and Boils If one removes a wet (living) wart or boil using a utensil, it constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1581 If the wart or boil is dry or one does not use a utensil, it is a Rabbinic pro- hibition, even if it would have fallen off by itself.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1572. Like most of the  melachos  that we have discussed, if one needs what he has sheared, it  constitutes the Torah prohibition. If he wants to beautify himself by removing the hair, it is a  disagreement among the Rishonim.

275,25/04/2026,GOZEZ: BRUSHING HAIR,"We have seen that shearing is forbidden on Shabbos. Brushing Hair It is forbidden to brush or comb one’s hair on Shabbos, 1582 even though he does not intend to remove any hair. 1583 Consequently, brushes and combs are muktzeh and may not be handled. However, one may use a very soft brush that does not detach hairs if it is a brush that is specified for Shabbos use. Note that such a brush is very hard to find, and even if one found one, it should not be used if the hair is knotty and tied. Therefore, this leniency is not very practical. One may run his hands through hair or separate the hair on a part. 1584 Mikvah If a woman who needs to go to the mikvah on Shabbos forgot to comb her hair properly beforehand, she should ask a non-Jew to do so. 1585 Lice in Hair If a child has lice and is in distress because of it, one can ask a non-Jew to comb the child’s hair. 1586 However, it is better to spray the hair with anti-lice spray. 1587 Rubbing One’s Eyes, Nose, or Beard One may gently rub his eyes, nose, or beard, provided that he does not intend to remove any hairs. 1588 Removing a Band-Aid One must be careful not to remove a Band-Aid if it is placed on top of any hair, but he may ask a non-Jew to do so. Another solution is to prepare, before Shabbos, medical liquid that loosens Band-Aids and pour it on the area on Shab- bos. 1589 Regarding washing netilas yadayim while wearing a Band-Aid on his hand, one should consult a Rav . 1590 Wigs Some Poskim hold that one may not comb a wig on Shabbos. 1591 If one does, she should only comb lightly with a designated Shabbos brush that is different from the weekday one. 1592 Clips One may wear clips in their hair. Braiding As mentioned previously, braiding____ is forbidden on Shabbos, 1594 even on a doll or a wig. 1595 Undoing braids is also prohibited, but one may remove the ponytail holders, provided that the braid will not fall apart immediately. 1596 One may put their hair into a ponytail without braiding it. Spraying Mousse One may not spray mousse, hair spray, or gel onto their hair or wig to keep it in place. 1597",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1582. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  303:27.

276,26/04/2026,GOZEZ: OTHER PRACTICAL ISSUES,"We have seen that it is forbidden to shear any hair or skin from an animal or person. Removing Hair or Feathers from Chicken Gozez is transgressed even if the animal is already dead, such as in the case of a piece of chicken. Note that raw chicken is generally muktzeh , unless one plans to feed it to animals on Shabbos. However, once the chicken is cooked, one may be lenient____ and follow the opinion that removing hair or feathers from cooked food no longer constitutes shearing. 1599 However, he must avoid transgressing borer (selecting). Therefore, he should ideally take the feather or hair off with some meat attached to it, 1600 or remove the feather by hand just before eating the chicken (see Days___ and___). 1601 Genuine-Leather Shoes or Articles One may not remove a strand from a genuine-leather article. 1602 Wax on the Body If one has wax on the body, he may not remove it if it will almost certainly remove hair with it. 1603 Scented Hair Spray Although hair spray that will set the hair is prohibited, hair spray that makes the hair smell pleasant may be used on Shabbos, because it is part of one’s body. However, it may not be used on wigs since wigs are considered garments, and there is a Rabbinic prohibition of making a garment smell pleasant on Shabbos (see Day___). 1604",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1598. See  Orchos Shabbos  17:9, which quotes Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in the name of Rav Yehoshua Leib Diskin, that  gozez  does not apply to cooked food.
1599. It is worth noting that  Kitzur Hilchos Shabbos  18:2 cites some  Poskim  who are stringent.  He concludes that one may certainly be lenient in a case of need.

277,27/04/2026,ZOREH (WINNOWING),"Introduction One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan was zoreh (win- nowing). After extracting the seeds, they would then toss them into the wind. The chaff would separate from the grain, as the grain weighed more than the chaff. 1605 However, being that the purpose of winnowing is to split an unwanted item from what is wanted using the wind, one can be lenient when throwing things into the wind in order to get rid of them, and not to fix them. We will now discuss some practical applications. Red Peels on Peanuts One may not blow off the red peel that is on top of peanuts. 1606 Spitting into the Wind Although some are stringent not to spit into the wind because it will be separated into particles (which is like zoreh ), 1607 , the general view is that this is not an issue. 1608 Chametz on Pesach If one finds chametz on Pesach, he is not allowed to burn it on Yom Tov. 1609 Instead, he must cover it with a vessel and burn it on Chol HaMoed or after Yom Tov. However, according to some Poskim , one may break it down and throw it into the wind so that it will be dispersed and unusable, provided that he does not transgress the prohibition of tochen (see Day___). 1610 Shaking Out Tablecloths One may shake out a tablecloth in order to get rid of the crumbs on it, even if the wind is blowing. 1611 Air Freshener One may spray air freshener into the air. However, one may not spray air freshener or deodorant onto clothes. COLD-WATER HUMIDIFIERS A cold-water humidifier merely takes cold water and sprays it as a mist. Assuming that this is how the humidifier functions, one may add water to it on Shabbos. If doing so involves any electrical changes or heating up of water (see below), it is forbidden. 1612 HOT-WATER HUMIDIFIERS It is almost always forbidden to add water to a hot-water humidifier, as it constitutes the melachah of bishul . If one is ill to the point of needing bed rest, he may instruct a non-Jew to pour water in. One should consult a Rav to clarify the circumstances of this leniency. 1613",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1605. Rambam,  Hilchos Shabbos  8:11.

279,29/04/2026,TZOVE’A (DYEING),"Introduction Many materials for the Mishkan needed to be dyed. Therefore, coloring any surface or object constitutes the melachah of tzove’a . All coloring is forbidden. However, applying a color that will last constitutes the Torah prohibition, 1618 whereas applying a color that will not last constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 1619 All forms of coloring are forbidden, even if one is coloring onto a color that was there previously. Practical Applications • One may not paint a picture, a wall, or tefillin boxes or straps. • One may not paint her nails even if the polish is transparent. 1620 • One may not polish shoes using a liquid shoe polish, 1621 even if they were polished before Shabbos. 1622 (Using cream also constitutes memare’ach [smoothing].) However, one may use a cloth to gently wipe his dusty shoes (see Day___). 1623 • One may not add colored powder to water with the sole intent of making a colored mixture. 1624 We will discuss coloring food in more detail soon. • One may not pour colored detergent into a toilet. One should remove a container that emits dyed detergent into a toilet before Shabbos. If one did not, he should preferably use a different facility, or remove it abnormally (as it is muktzeh ). 1625",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1617.

280,30/04/2026,TZOVE’A: COLORING FOOD,"We have seen that coloring any surface or object using dye or ink is prohibited. Coloring food is basically permitted. 1626 However, some hold that it is for- bidden when one’s intent is for the sake of the appearance. 1627 It is correct to be strict in deference to this opinion. There is a single opinion that holds that one should never add colorant to a food (or liquid), even when his intent is not to change the color. If it is possible to be strict in deference to this opinion it is commendable, but if it is not practical, then one can add the colorant to the food in accordance with the first view. 1628 Also, one is only permitted to color food that one will eat, not food that he plans to sell or use in some other fashion. We will now discuss some practical applications. Making Tea We have mentioned that one may not use tea bags on Shabbos, as doing so constitutes bishul (cooking), but one may use tea essence or concentrate that was prepared before Shabbos. One may pour tea essence into a cup of hot water (once it is at least a kli sheini ) even though the color of the water will change. 1629 Some are stringent, and only pour the hot water (from a kli sheini ) onto the tea essence. Making Coffee One may pour coffee powder into a cup that has hot water in it (once it is a kli sheini ). 1630 However, some are stringent, and only pour the water (from a kli sheini ) onto the coffee powder in a third vessel, in order to avoid coloring the water. Pouring Red Wine into White Wine It is preferable to make Shabbos-night Kiddush on red wine. 1631 One may pour red wine into white wine in order to make it red. 1632 However, some are stringent and switch the order, pouring the red wine first, and then adding the white wine to it. Note that some Poskim write that this not good enough to be considered red wine. 1633 Making Juice from Concentrate One may pour concentrate into water even though the color will change. This is because one’s intention is for the flavor, not for the color. However, some are stringent, and add water to the concentrate. Making Charoses One may mix wine into ground apple, cinnamon, and nuts on Yom Tov. 1634 Note that on Shabbos, mixing a liquid and a solid together constitutes lash (kneading). If one did not prepare it before Shabbos, he must change the order of mixing them, and only mix them in an unusual manner. (Refer to the relevant halachos in Day___.) Making Stained Glass One may not stain a glass jar by pouring color into water and leaving the jar in the sun. Coloring is only permitted for food that one plans to eat. Decorative Flower Vases Some people pour color into flower jars as decoration. One may not do this on Shabbos. 1635 Coloring is only permitted for food that one plans to eat.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1626. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  320:19. See  Mishnah Berurah  320:56, which states that the  Pri Megadim  holds that it is permitted in all cases when one’s intent is to eat the food, not to sell it.
1627. The  Mishnah Berura h there quotes the  Nishmas Adam , which states that it is better to  refrain from doing so — the  Shulchan Aruch  only permitted mustard in food for the taste, but  not for the appearance.

281,01/05/2026,TZOVE’A: MAKEUP,"We have seen that coloring any surface or object using any sort of colorant is forbidden. However, coloring food that one will eat is permitted (although some are stringent). Makeup A woman may not use makeup on Shabbos, as coloring on the human body is also prohibited. 1636 This is true even if the color used is the same as one’s skin. 1637 It is also prohibited to add more color even if she had the makeup on from before Shabbos. 1638 • One may not use lipstick, mascara, blush, or face powder____ on Shabbos. (Using lipstick also constitutes memare’ach [smoothing] [see Day___].) • Talc, which has no oil base and does not last, may be used. A Makeup Brush One may not even use a makeup brush that was just used to wipe one’s face, as it will definitely affect the color of the skin. 1640 A brush may not even be used to maintain the current color. 1641 Nail Polish One may not paint nails on Shabbos, even with transparent polish. 1642 Moreover, some Poskim rule that a woman may not remove nail polish on Shabbos. A Rav should be consulted. 1643 Mikvah Night A woman who needs to go to the mikvah on Friday night must be certain to remove her nail polish before Shabbos. According to those Poskim who rule that removing nail polish is forbidden, if she forgot to remove it beforehand: • If it is well painted and fully covers her nails, in a way that she would be comfortable presenting herself in public ( i.e., she is not embarrassed by the state of her nail polish), she should not remove the nail polish. She should immerse with her nails as they are. 1644 • If they are not well painted or have cracks or blotches, in a way that she would prefer not to be seen in that state, some say____ that she should ask a non-Jew to remove it. If this is not possible, some Poskim allow her to do it herself in the following manner: she should pour acetone or nail polish remover onto the nail directly (not onto cotton wool), and only afterwards wipe it gently with cotton wool, being certain not to squeeze the wool. A Rav should be consulted in either of the above cases. 1646 Sunbathing One may not deliberately sit in the sun in order to cause his skin to dark- en. 1647 However, one may sit in the sun for enjoyment, even though his skin may get tanned. 1648 Exfoliating One may not put minerals or avocado on his skin, as removing them will cause the skin color to change. This may also involve the prohibition of me- machek (smoothing) — see Day___. 1649",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1636. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  303:25.

282,02/05/2026,TZOVE’A: WIPING DIRT,"We have seen that coloring any surface or object using any sort of colorant is forbidden. However, coloring food that one will eat is permitted (although some are stringent not to). Using makeup is also forbidden. Until now, we have discussed situations in which one is transferring color onto something else. We will now discuss the halachah regarding one who wishes to remove the color (stain) from something, even though it transfers to something else in the process. It is also worth mentioning that liquids absorbed into fabrics present a problem of sechitah (squeezing) (see Day___). Removing a Stain off Oneself There is a dispute whether removing a stain by transferring it to something else constitutes tzove’a . Therefore, the halachah is as follows: • Ideally, one should avoid wiping his dirty or colored hands directly onto a cloth. He should preferably rinse them under water first. 1650 • If that is not possible, one may wipe them on a cloth or surface that is a different color from the stain or dirt on his hands, so that it will not cause the existing color to be strengthened. 1651 • If no such cloth or surface is available, one may wipe his hands on some- thing that is the same color. 1652 Note that one may wipe his hands on any disposable tissue or napkin, re- gardless of color, if he would throw it away immediately after use. 1653 Practical Applications Sauce on Hands If one’s hands are full of red sauce, he should rinse his hands before wiping them on anything that is not disposable. If that is not possible, he may wipe them on something that is not red. If that is not possible, he may wipe them on something red. (The same halachos apply to muddy hands regarding anything that is brown.) He may always wipe it on something that is always disposed of immediately after use. Bleeding Wounds and Nosebleeds If one has a bleeding wound, he should rinse it under water so that it will not stain the cloth that he will wipe it on. If that is not possible, he may wipe it on a cloth that is not red. However, he may even use a red cloth if he has no other color. 1654 He may always wipe it with something that is always disposed of immediately after use, such as gauze or tissue. Therefore, if one is suffering from hemorrhoids, he may wipe himself with a tissue even though the blood will be transferred onto it. 1655 (See also Day___ regarding treatment of wounds, and Day___ regarding use of ointment.) Wine That Spilled on the Table If wine spilled on a white tablecloth, one should leave it as is. 1656 If it has not yet been absorbed, one may place rags there to soak it up, but he may not pat them onto the spill to absorb more, because that would constitute sechitah (squeezing). When he removes the rags, he must hold them from the dry edge and ensure that he does not squeeze out the wine that was absorbed. The best suggestion is to use tissues or paper towels, making sure to throw them away immediately after use and not to squeeze them. If there are no tissues, one may lift the tablecloth so that the wine flows off of it (even though it will make more of the tablecloth red). 1657 Women’s Niddah Cloth A woman may do the necessary checks regarding family purity, even though the cloths may become stained. 1658",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1650.

283,03/05/2026,TZOVE’A: MORE PRACTICAL  APPLICATIONS,"We have covered the basic rules of tzove’a : • One may not color any material or surface. • One may color food that he will eat (although some are stringent not to do so). • One may not put on makeup. • One should wash his hands or wounds before wiping the dirt on a cloth. If necessary, he may wipe on an item that is a different color. If that is also not possible, he may wipe on anything. (One may always wipe on something disposable, provided that it is always discarded after use and is not squeezed.) We will now discuss a few more applications of tzove’a . Colored Fruit or Candy One may eat colored fruit or candy even though it stains the face or hands. 1659 Glasses That Tint in the Sun One may wear glasses that tint in the sun. 1660 Watches That Glow in the Dark One may wear a watch that glows in the dark. 1661 Diapers with an Indicator One may put a diaper on a child even if it has a strip that changes color when the diaper is wet. 1662 Thermometers One may not use a thermometer that flashes the temperature or a color. 1663 Obviously, if there is a danger to life, one must do whatever is necessary to save it. (See also Day___ regarding other types of thermometers.) Children’s Cutlery That Changes Color When Heated One may not use a spoon that changes color when inserted into a hot drink. The same is true of a mug that changes color or flashes writing when one pours something hot into it. 1664",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1659.

284,04/05/2026,MECHATECH (CUTTING),"Introduction One of the creative acts that took place in the Mishkan was cutting. Cutting any material to a desired size constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1665 Practical Examples Plastic Wrap, Tablecloths, and Aluminum Foil Cutting plastic wrap, plastic tablecloths, or aluminum foil to size constitutes the Torah prohibition. Cutting a Shoe Cutting a shoe or insole to size constitutes the Torah prohibition. Dental Floss Cutting dental floss to size constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1666 (Note that precut dental floss may only be used if it is likely that it will not cause bleeding [see Day___].) Cotton Wool Cutting cotton wool to a desired size constitutes the Torah prohibition. Note that using cotton wool with liquids on Shabbos generally constitutes sechitah (squeezing). Toilet Paper One may not tear toilet paper on the perforated lines. 1667 One must prepare tissues (or cut toilet paper) before Shabbos. In an extreme case where one did not prepare them beforehand and is stuck, he can tear it abnormally (such as by using his elbows) off of the perforated lines. Making Toothpicks One may not break a long match into two to use as a toothpick.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1665. Mishnah Berurah  322:18. If the cut has been manufactured (that is, perforated in the fac- tory), it still constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition.

285,05/05/2026,"MECHATECH: OPENING BOTTLES,  CONTAINERS, AND PACKAGES","We have seen that cutting something to a desired size constitutes the Torah prohibition. Opening Bottles, Containers, and Packages Two basic rules apply to opening packages. 1. Opening a metal container that one will continue to use for the indef- inite future is forbidden, according to many opinions. 1668 If one leaves the metal seal attached after opening, it is permitted. • Examples include a bottle of grape juice with a metal cap, 1669 a con- tainer of baby formula, and a can of tuna or fruit. The only way one may open these is by making a hole in the container, effectively ru- ining it for further usage. One can then open it normally. One may not open a can by pulling off a metal tab. 1670 However, one may open it if the tab is left on. 1671_. Regarding a sealed disposable plastic or paper container that one will empty out and throw away shortly and that has a specific opening, some are stringent and some are lenient. • Examples include a bottle of soda with a plastic lid, a new carton (or bag) of milk, a new bag of nosh, a new sugar packet — but not where the edges are stuck together, and a container with a plastic cap that tears a paper seal as it is turned. According to the stringent opinion, these may not be opened (but they may be opened if one makes a hole in them first). 1672 According to the lenient opinion, these may be opened, although some Poskim hold that one should do so with a shinui . 1673_. One may open____ a paper or plastic package that will be discarded immediately. 1675 • Examples include mini sugar or ketchup packets and small bags of nosh. One may tear it open with his hands. Note that one should avoid any potential issues by opening all packages before Shabbos. Also, even in permitted cases, one may not cut or rip where there is writing on the package. More Examples of Actions That Are Permitted under Mechatech • Removing a cork • Removing the foil freshness seal of a new jar of coffee or container of yogurt (watch for letters) • Removing staples____",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1668.

286,06/05/2026,MECHATECH: FOOD - FOOD,"Food for Eating The melachah of mechatech does not apply to food that is being cut for eat- ing. 1677 (However, as we have discussed, food that grows from the ground is subject to the melachah of tochen (grinding) — see Days___—126. • One may cut a pineapple into pieces, provided that he is not cutting so small as to constitute the melachah of tochen (grinding). • One may cut meat into fine pieces. ( Tochen only applies to things that grow from the ground.) • In cases that one is permitted to take medicine (see Day___), one may break a pill in half (taking care to avoid erasing the writing), as it is considered a form of food. 1678 Cutting When Not for Eating Mechatech does not apply when cutting for eating. However, cutting food into shapes is forbidden. 1679 • One may not cut a watermelon into the shape of a basket. 1680 • One may not cut an orange peel into shapes. • One may not make a smiley face out of food. Intricate Shapes and Writing As we have seen previously, forming any intricate writing on food is also prohibited. • One may make basic shapes such as squares, triangles, and circles out of food, provided that it will be eaten that way. 1681 However, one may not make anything more intricate such as a face or a sun in a piece of meat, or a letter out of fruit, as this constitutes kosev____ (see Day___). Although cutting food itself is permitted, opening a container for the food within is still subject to the halachos that we have discussed in Days___—251.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1676.

287,07/05/2026,MENAPETZ;  TEVIAH;  MEISACH;   OSEH BATEI NIRIN,"Some melachos are not so applicable in our times. However, it is worthwhile (and indeed, a mitzvah) to learn about them, both for the rare practical applica- tions and in order to gain reward as if we have kept them. The Mishnah Berurah mentions these three melachos briefly at the end of the halachos of Shabbos. 1683 Menapetz After the wool was well cleaned, they would then scrape, comb, and flay it into finer and cleaner pieces, to ready it for spinning. The process of scraping or combing constitutes the melachah of menapetz . • One may not separate the leaves on a lulav in order to make a basket or handle. Doing so constitutes menapetz . 1684 Teviah After the wool was well combed, cleaned, and separated, 1685 it would be spun into usable string-like pieces. This constitutes the melachah of teviah . All fabric today is made up of extremely fine pieces of thread that have been wound into thicker threads. Twisting thread together is known as shezirah , and is included in the melachah of teviah . 1686 • If the thin threads that make up one’s tzitzis string became frayed (there are about sixteen very thin threads in each string), one may not wind them back into one. • One may not wind the wicks that he will use to light candles on Yom Tov. 1687 Meisach and Oseh Batei Nirin Threading strings through a frame constitutes the melachah of meisach . 1688 Threading vertical strings through horizontal strings or loops as part of making material constitutes the melachah of oseh batei nirin . • One may not string thread through canvas, nor cane or reed through the holes of a bed or chair frame. 1689 Since the contemporary literature on these melacho s is limited, one should consult a Rav should the concern arrive that a particular act resembles them.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1682.

288,08/05/2026,TOFER (SEWING),"One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan was tofer (sew- ing). Therefore, sewing is forbidden on Shabbos.DEFINING TOFER The Torah prohibition is transgressed when one threads a needle back and forth through fabric twice and ties a knot at the end to prevent it from coming undone. 1690 Threading the needle back and forth three times constitutes the Torah prohibition even if a knot is not tied afterwards. 1691 Nevertheless, threading a needle once constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition (even if one does not tie it off). • If a hole forms in one’s shirt, he may not sew it up at all. Threading it through twice and tying it constitutes the Torah prohibition. Sewing it once, even if one does not tie it, constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Tightening a Loose Thread Tightening a loose thread also constitutes the Torah prohibition. Therefore, one may not pull a thread that will tighten the stitching. 1692 • If one’s button has started to become loose, pulling the threads to tighten it back onto the shirt constitutes the Torah prohibition. Tightening Temporarily Making a temporary stitch that is likely to become detached is the subject of dispute. Thus, even if pulling the thread will not permanently fix the issue, 1693 one should avoid doing so. 1694 Normal Usage If pulling a string or thread is the normal way to use the garment (and it is produced that way), doing so is permitted. 1695 • In garments such as pajamas or sweatpants, one may pull the ends of the elastic that come out by the waist. (Note that making a double knot is prohibited under the melachah of kosher [tying].) Similarly, one may pull the strings to tighten children’s hats and raincoat hoods.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1690. Mishnah Berurah  340:27.

289,09/05/2026,TOFER: STICKING PAPERS TOGETHER,"Until now, we have dealt with sewing or pulling fabric. However, the melachah of tofer also includes attaching papers____ or other soft materials____ such as reeds or leaves together. • One may not stick an envelope flap closed. 1698 • One may not adhere a label to a paper or book. 1699 • One may not attach two papers using glue or tape. • The top tip of one’s lulav should ideally be one unit (not split into two leaves). Sticking the two leaves together is a good solution during the week, but is forbidden on Shabbos or Yom Tov. 1700 • One may not use a stapler. 1701 When One Surface Is Hard The melachah of tofer applies to two soft and pliable materials. If one of the materials is hard, where other factors exists, some Poskim rule that there is no prohibition of tofer . 1702 However, a Rav should be consulted to verify each case. • One may place a hot baby bottle into a bowl of cold water to cool the contents, even though the label that is attached will come off. 1703 • A doctor may not stick a label onto a test tube; he should rather attach the identity tag using a rubber band. 1704",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1696.

290,10/05/2026,TOFER: DIAPERS,"Closing the Tabs of a Diaper As mentioned previously, there is a dispute among the Poskim regarding sewing or sticking things together for a limited period of time. This is particu- larly relevant to putting on and taking off a diaper, since the seal that closes the diaper is temporary. One certainly can be lenient and stick the tape tabs of a diaper, even though it is possible that they will remain for an extended period of time, as this is the way they are made to operate, similar to buttons and snaps. 1705 One may also be lenient and wrap up the diaper by sticking the sides together to limit the smell. Although the tabs that are stuck together are likely to remain indefinitely, the fact that they will remain that way is of no concern to anyone. 1706 However, as we have mentioned, some Poskim are strict regarding even tem- porary sewing. 1707 If one wishes to fulfill all opinions, he should be sure to use diapers with tabs made of Velcro. Velcro is not considered “sewing,” as it does not actually stick like glue. Today, most better-quality diapers have Velcro tabs, and are therefore suit- able for Shabbos use even according to the stringent opinion. Other Issues with Diapers Preparing the Diaper Before Shabbos Tearing apart or unsticking a diaper presents a possible transgression of the melachah of kore’a (tearing) (see Day___—262). However, the sticky edges of a diaper are temporary, and the same halachah that applies above applies here. Ideally, one should remove plastic adhesives from the diaper before Shabbos. However, if he did not do so, he may be lenient and remove them as usual. 1708 Opening the Sides of a New Diaper As one removes a diaper from the package, the sides appear to be stuck to- gether, rendering them unusable until one unravels or tears them open. Making something usable is forbidden under makkeh b’patish (making an item usable). However, it has been determined that most diapers are actually manufactured open and flat (and the sides are not stuck together). Only during the packaging process does the heat of the press cause the sides to become somewhat attached. The halachah is that one may separate something that was originally attached inadvertently. 1709 However, one must ensure that writing or images are not created or erased when attaching or tearing things apart. In Summary • Opening the sides of a diaper is permitted (for most brands). • Removing the plastic adhesive is best done before Shabbos. If one did not do so, he may do so on Shabbos. • It is best to use diapers that have Velcro tabs. If one does not have such diapers, he may use the ones he has. The same applies to opening the tabs when removing the diapers from the baby.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1705. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  15:87;  Orchos Shabbos  11:36.

291,11/05/2026,TOFER: ON THE BODY;  BAND-AIDS,"The melachah of tofer also applies to adhering things to the human body. However, because the things that one sticks to the body are usually there for a limited time, one may generally be lenient (as we have discussed in Days___—256). Band-Aids There are two considerations regarding Band-Aids. First, removing the Band-Aid from the tab that it was stuck to when pur- chased may be a problem of detaching two things from each other — kore’a (see Day___). One should prepare the Band-Aid in advance, but if one did not, he can be lenient and do so on Shabbos. 1710 Second, attaching one sticky edge to the other is a classic case of attaching two soft materials to each other, and constitutes tofer . 1711 This is certainly for- bidden unless it will be removed within a day (a temporary attachment). 1712 Stitches A doctor should preferably not make internal stitches in the body on Shab- bos. 1713 Sewing on the body is also likely to constitute the melachah of tofer . 1714 Drawing blood may also constitute shochet (see Days___—303). A non-Jew may do so if the Jew is a choleh she’ein bo sakanah . Obviously, if the situation is life-threatening, one must do whatever is necessary to save a Jewish life.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1710. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  35:27.

We will now discuss a few practical applications. Buttons, Snaps, and Zippers • One may close buttons, snaps, zippers, 1715 and cuff links on a garment, as they are made to open and close. If any of these completely break, one may not fix them on Shabbos. 1716 Furthermore, if a button becomes detached from a garment, although it is not definitely considered muktzeh , one should preferably avoid moving or handling it. 1717 Safety Pins One may use a safety pin on a temporary basis because it is made to con- stantly open and close, similar to a button. However, one must only stick it into both sides once, and not more, since making two holes may constitute tofer . 1718 • One may use a safety pin in the place of a lost cuff link. It should be inserted from one side of the sleeve directly into the second side of the sleeve, and closed on the other side.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1715.

293,13/05/2026,KORE’A (TEARING),"Introduction The opposite side of the melachah of tofer (sewing) is the melachah of kore’a (tearing). Just like making two stitches or attaching two soft materials together is prohibited, tearing them apart is also prohibited. 1719 The Categories Tearing apart one material from another for a particular purpose constitutes the Torah prohibition. In addition, Chazal decreed that tearing one material from another is prohibited even if there is no purpose for doing so. 1720 Kore’a and Mechatech On the face of it, the melachah of kore’a (tearing) appears to be the same as the melachah of mechatech (cutting), but there are some differences on the Torah-prohibition level: • The melachah of mechatech applies to measured cutting, whereas the melachah of kore’a is transgressed even when one rips something for a purpose, without any care for precision. 1721 • The melachah of mechatech can be incurred even with the slightest cut, provided it is done to improve the object, whereas the melachah of kore’a is only incurred when one rips two stitches’ worth. 1722 Note that these differences are purely theoretical. Practically, they are both prohibited regardless (at least Rabbinically). Practical Applications • If two pages were intentionally stuck together with glue, separating them constitutes the melachah of kore’a . 1723 NOTE: If the pages of old bentshers are stuck together, one may separate them, as they were never considered bound. 1724 However, if the writing will get erased while doing so, as is the case in most instances unless they are well laminated, it is forbidden under mochek (erasing). • If the cuffs on one’s clothing came loose on one side, he may not rip the other end. The above cases constitute Torah prohibitions because there is a purpose to the ripping.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1719. Shabbos  75a.

Tearing without a particular purpose is Rabbinically forbidden. More Practical Applications • One may not tear open the folds of a large sealed envelope____ in a care- ful way, so that the envelope will be reusable afterwards. 1726 In cases of great need, one may ask a non-Jew to rip it in a way that it will be usable thereafter. 1727 • One may not tear toilet paper on Shabbos, but should prepare toilet paper before Shabbos. If one has no other option, he may only tear it off of the perforated lines with a shinui (abnormally), such as with his elbow____ (see Day___ for more details). • One may not tear open a large garbage bag and make a hole at the top to use as an impromptu raincoat. 1729 • One may not remove a label from a book, even just to throw it out. • One may not tear candy wrappers for no purpose. However, as we will see, tearing to get to its contents is permitted. • One may not tear a fabric bandage into separate pieces. 1730 • According to some Poskim , one may not undo a Band-Aid that was wrapped around his finger for an extended period of time by separating the two tabs from each other.

He must destroy the bag when opening it, and not open it on the flap so that the bag is reusable. 1737 • If one forgot to remove the identification tag stapled on a garment by the dry cleaners, he may do so on Shabbos, being careful not to tear the writing. 1738 However, it is forbidden to remove it if it was sewn on. 1739",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1732.

296,16/05/2026,KORE’A: WHEN TEARING IS PERMITTED,"We have seen that tearing or detaching one item from another for a purpose constitutes the Torah prohibition, and ripping something without a purpose is Rabbinically forbidden. However, there are some instances when tearing is permitted. For a Different Purpose and Destroys the Item According to some Poskim , if one’s purpose is not for the tear itself and doing so renders the item unusable, one may tear the item. This is particularly relevant regarding opening packages of food. The purpose of the tearing is only to get to the contents inside, and the newly opened bag usually becomes undesirable and unusable. 1740 • One may tear open a bag of potato chips, 1741 provided that he does not tear where there is writing. NOTE: We have discussed the details regarding opening packages in both boneh (see Days___—197) and mechatech (Day___). Unintentionally Attached When two separate things were attached unintentionally, one may separate them. 1742 • If coffee spilled on a book, causing two pages to stick together, one may separate them provided that it does not affect the letters. 1743 • However, if the pages of a new book were never separate to begin with, detaching them for the first time constitutes the Torah prohibition of makkeh b’patish (making an item usable). Not Actually Attached Kore’a only applies to two things that are actually attached. If they are not really attached, one may cut or tear the item to destroy it. 1744 • If a new garment has a label that is attached with a plastic cord, one may cut the cord. This is because the label was never really sewn or attached to the garment. 1745",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1740. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  9:3.

297,17/05/2026,ME’ABED (TREATING LEATHER),"Introduction One of the creative acts that were performed in the Mishkan is me’abed — treating animal hides to make them usable as leather. There are several different actions that constitute me’abed : placing the skins in lime or salt water, adding tanning solutions to the water, salting the skin, flattening it, softening it, and pulling it taut. Doing any of these constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1746 Practical Applications • One may not bend a new shoe to soften the stiffness and make it more comfortable. However, one may insert a shoehorn into a shoe to retain its shape and prevent shrinking, but not to repair a shoe that is out of shape. 1747 • One may not perform any of the processes involved in preparing leather straps for tefillin . • According to some Poskim , polishing shoes with shoe polish also con- stitutes the melachah of me’abed (in addition to the melachos of tzove’a [dyeing] and memare’ach [smoothing].) 1748 • One may not pour oil or other liquids onto leather shoes to treat them, as doing this to new shoes constitutes the Torah prohibition. The Mish- nah Berurah states that one should not do so even to old shoes in case others will think that doing so to new shoes is permitted. 1749 As with all Torah prohibitions of Shabbos, one may not ask a non-Jew to do any of the above. If a non-Jew did any of the above for a Jew on Shabbos (even without being asked to), it is forbidden to benefit from it during Shabbos, except under certain circumstances. A Rav should be consulted. We will discuss the practical applications of this melachah .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1746. Mishnah Berurah  327:12.

298,18/05/2026,ME’ABED: SALTING AND  PICKLING FOOD - FOOD,"Food The main distinction between trying to bring out the taste in food (which is permitted) and trying to preserve it (which is forbidden) is in the quantity that one salts and whether he is doing it as part of the eating process or not. 1753 Moreover, the prohibition only applies to those foods that are normally salted. Therefore, for example, one may pour salt onto eggs or tomatoes, for they are not usually salted — but he should only do so in order to eat on Shabbos. 1754 Practical Applications Salting Many Vegetables That Are Usually Pickled at the Same Time One may not salt or pickle a large quantity of vegetables at the same time, even if they are cut into slices. These include salting many onions, radishes, or cucumbers. It is also prohibited to pour salt onto even one vegetable and keep it there for a long period (with the intention of drawing out its juice), because it is obvious that one’s intention is to preserve it. 1755 One may dip vegetables in salt while eating. Furthermore, sprinkling salt on one vegetable at a time is also permitted. 1756 Vegetables That Are Not Usually Pickled One may sprinkle a dash of salt into a bowl of cut tomatoes to bring out the taste because it is not a food that is usually salted in this cut state, and his intention is not for preserving. 1757 Returning Vegetables to Brine One may not put whole cucumbers into brine to pickle them on Shabbos. 1758 One may return vegetables that were already fully pickled into the brine that they were stored in. Once something is pickled, there can be no further pickling afterwards. 1759 Adding Oil to Vegetables When one pours oil onto vegetables, the salt no longer has a pickling effect. Therefore, once there is already oil on the vegetables, one may pour salt onto them afterwards. 1760",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1750. Rambam,  Hilchos Shabbos  11:5.

299,19/05/2026,"ME’ABED: SALTING AND PICKLING  FOOD, CONTINUED","We have seen that Chazal prohibited salting or pickling food when it is done in a way that resembles the melachah of me’abed (treating leather). We have discussed several leniencies: • One may dip a single vegetable in salt while eating. • If the vegetables are not usually salted or pickled, one may even pour salt onto a larger quantity of vegetables, provided that he does not intend to preserve them. • As adding oil prevents any further salting, one may add salt to food that has oil in it. • One may return pickled food to brine. We will now discuss a few more leniencies. Salads and Salad Dressing If most of the vegetables in a salad are not usually salted or pickled, one may pour salt into it, provided that he does not intend to preserve it. 1761 Likewise, it is permitted to pour a salad dressing that has a high salt content over such a salad before eating. However, because some Poskim are stringent regarding even a mixed salad, it is best to add a touch of oil to it first. 1762 If Salting Does Not Affect It One may put salt onto avocado, cooked meat, eggs, or potatoes for immediate use, 1763 as salting will not preserve them, nor is it normal to do so on these foods. 1764 Salting raw meat or fish is forbidden. Therefore, making beef jerky (biltong) or herring on Shabbos is prohibited. Note that some cooked foods do, in fact, still react to salting, and therefore one may not salt them on Shabbos. Examples include cooked beans and lentils. 1765 Other Spices The prohibition applies only to salt. One may pour other spices onto veg- etables. 1766",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1761.

300,20/05/2026,ME’ABED: SALT WATER,"We have seen that salting a few vegetables at the same time is forbidden. However, it is permitted to put salt on vegetables that are not usually pickled, as well as on food that is not affected by pickling. Also, as oil neutralizes any subsequent salting, salting is permitted after oil has been added. Making Salt Water Chazal deemed making salt water similar to part of the leather-treating pro- cess. They therefore forbade making salt water on Shabbos, with the following qualifications: 1767_. Making very strong salt water (more than two parts salt to one part water) is forbidden even while eating. 2. One may make weaker salt water in small amounts for a Shabbos meal. 1768_. Because making salt water is forbidden, putting in oil afterwards will not mitigate the prohibition that has already been transgressed. How- ever, one may pour in oil before adding salt in any quantity. 1769 Pesach Night On Pesach night, the custom is to dip karpas (a vegetable) in salt water. If the Seder night falls out on Shabbos, one must prepare the salt water beforehand. If one forgot to do so, he may prepare a small amount, in a ratio of less than two parts salt to one part water. 1770 On a normal Yom Tov (that does not coincide with Shabbos) although it is permitted to make salt water since one is allowed to do certain melachos in preparing food on Yom Tov, one should nevertheless preferably do so before- hand. 1771 Summary of Me’abed • Any treatment of leather is forbidden, including softening new shoes, polishing old shoes, and pulling a leather hat or belt taut to repair it. • Pickling vegetables, raw meat, or raw fish is forbidden. • One may dip a single vegetable into salt and eat it. • Putting salt onto vegetables that are not usually pickled is permitted, provided that one does not intend to pickle or preserve them. • One should preferably pour a bit of oil onto a mixed salad that includes vegetables that are usually preserved before pouring salt onto it. • Making salt water is forbidden unless it is weak and for a Shabbos meal.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1767.

301,21/05/2026,MEMACHEK (SMOOTHING),"One of the melachos that were performed in the Mishkan was the scrap- ing and smoothing of leather. Thus, scraping and smoothing are prohibited on Shabbos. Smoothing, such as when rubbing ointment on the body, is known as memare’ach , which is a toldah (branch) of memachek. 1772 Smoothing Hard Surfaces Smoothing hard surfaces is forbidden on Shabbos. • One may not use sandpaper to smooth a piece of wood. 1773 • One may not rub two rocks together to make them smooth. • One may not sharpen two knives against each other. 1774 Dishes Cleaning dishes presents a few issues on Shabbos, one of which is memachek . Memachek Scrubbing a metal pot with dry steel wool is forbidden, 1775 even on Yom Tov. Sechitah One may not use a sponge or cloth, as it constitutes sechitah (squeezing) (see Days___—171). According to some opinions, one may use a synthetic brush in which the bristles are far apart from each other. This is particularly relevant regarding a bottle brush. 1776 One may dry the dishes with a dish towel, but one should not dry very narrow containers, as pressing down on the accumulated water will no doubt result in sechitah . 1777 Hachanah One may not prepare on Shabbos for after Shabbos, but one may wash plates that will be used on that day. 1778 Moreover, even if one only needs a few dishes, he may still wash all of them. 1779 Some are stringent not to wash any plates if there are others available. One may always wash drinking glasses. One may wash any dishes out of a concern that insects will come for the leftover food. (One may not kill or trap any insects.) One may soak water in pots to prevent grime from accumulating, which is considered an immediate need, but one may not wash them fully. If the dirt has already dried on the plates, one may not soak them, since the whole intention of soaking them is to make cleaning them later much easier. 1780 (See Day___ for more details about hachanah .) Bishul One may not open the hot-water faucet to wash dishes, as it would constitute bishul by causing cold water to enter the boiler (see Day__). Furthermore, many dishwashing liquids have not been boiled, and thus pouring hot water onto dishwashing liquid (even from a kli sheini ) is forbidden. However, one may dissolve dishwashing liquid in cold water. 1781",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1772. Shabbos  75b.

Memachek also includes smoothing, rubbing, and flattening soft or pliable surfaces. This is known as memare’ach . Practical Applications • One may not flatten the insulating rubber on window panes. • One may not use Vaseline or lipstick. 1782 (Lipstick also constitutes tzove’a .) One may put oil on his chapped lips, but he must not rub it in. 1783 • One may not use a deodorant stick. Spray and liquid roll-on deodorants are permitted. 1784 • One may not play with playdough. (This may also constitute kosev and/ or boneh if words or images are formed. Making playdough also con- stitutes lash .) Ointment Smoothing thick ointment onto bandages or skin constitutes the Torah prohibition. 1785 Smoothing regular creams, such has hand cream and moisturizer, is Rabbinically forbidden. 1786 In addition, to safeguard this prohibition, Chazal forbade placing a bandage that already has ointment on it onto one’s body. Even if the bandage was on the body from before Shabbos, and fell off on Shabbos, it may not be replaced if it fell on the floor. However, if it fell onto any other surface, one may replace it. Note that one may not put on a bandage by tying it in a knot or attaching it to its own adhesive. Rather, one may tie it in a bow, or attach it onto the skin with its adhesive. 1787 (See Days___ and___ for more details.) Applying Medical Ointment One may dab ointment on a wound without smearing it. Chazal only for- bade smearing it on, not merely applying it. • A choleh she’ein bo sakanah ( a person who is ill to the point of needing bed rest but whose life is not in danger, or whose entire body is in pain) may dab ointment or antiseptic cream onto a wound or rash, and gently place a Band-Aid or bandage over it.

303,23/05/2026,"MEMACHEK: SOAP, EAR PLUGS,  CREAM, PASTE, AND OIL","We have seen that scraping a hard surface is prohibited under the melachah of memachek . Also included in the melachah are smoothing, rubbing, and flattening soft or pliable surfaces, known as memare’ach . The prohibition applies to anything that is at least somewhat thick or semi- dense, such that it is considered a mass. It does not apply to something that is viscous or easily pourable. Soap: Bars and Liquid There are two problems with using a bar of soap. First, transmuting a solid into a different form (known as molid ) is prohibited. 1788 Second, smoothing a hard surface ( memachek ) or a soft substance ( memare’ach ) are prohibited, as we have discussed. The only option when washing one’s body or vessels is liquid soap. This is because memare’ach does not apply to liquid. 1789 Ear Plugs There is a dispute among the Poskim regarding the use of wax and silicone ear plugs, as they mold to the shape of one’s ear and often have an oil base. 1790 The prevalent conclusion is that one should not use them. 1791 Cotton and sponge ear plugs are permitted. Cream and Paste Thicker hand and skin cream and Vaseline are all semi-dense, and may not be used. Liquids and Fluids Liquids and fluids such as baby oil, liquid hand creams, and sanitizers may be used.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1788.

(Note that making icing is prohibited under the melachah of lash [kneading]. Icing must be made before Shabbos.) • One may use an ice cream scoop, even though it automatically smooths the ice cream. Prohibitions Regarding Food Aesthetic Purposes If the purpose of smearing or smoothing is not for eating, it is better not to do so, even though it will be eaten. This is because it resembles the Torah prohibition of preparing leather. 1794 • It is better not to smooth the surface of a tuna or egg salad if one is doing so merely for presentation purposes. 1795 • It is better not to mash a banana into a shape____ (even if one does so with a shinui to avoid tochen [see Day___]). Note that making shapes is also prohibited under kosev (writing). • It is better not to spread icing on a cake just for the sake of beauty. Non- Food Purposes There is a Rabbinic decree forbidding smearing or smoothing food for a non-food purpose. • One may not plug a hole with chewing gum. 1797 • One may not smear butter or margarine on his lips to prevent chap- ping. 1798",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1792.

Smoothing or rubbing soft or pliable surfaces (known as memare’ach ) is prohibited. 3. The prohibition applies to anything that is at least somewhat thick or semi-dense. It does not apply to something that is viscous or easily pourable. 4. The prohibition does not apply to foods, although it is praiseworthy to avoid smearing foods as well. It is also praiseworthy not to smear foods for aesthetic purposes. Smearing food for non-food purposes is prohibited. Sunscreen One may not smear thick or semi-thick sunscreen or lotion into his skin to prevent sunburns. However, one may use sunscreen in a liquid form. (Al- though taking medicine is forbidden on Shabbos, preventing ailments is per- mitted. 1799 ) One is allowed to lie in the sun for enjoyment even if by doing so he will get a tan. But one may not use even liquid suntan lotion in order to get a tan on Shabbos. 1800 Treating sunburn is prohibited unless one’s entire body is aching. Scraping Dirt from Skin Although scraping a hard or soft surface is forbidden, one may scrape dirt off of skin. 1801 If it crumbles, however, it is a problem of tochen (see Day___). • One may scrape off mud from his skin or wipe it with a dry cloth or towel that he does not care to keep clean. One may not use a wet cloth. 1802 Scabs and Warts If a scab is fully dried out in a way that scraping it off will not cause any bleeding, one may scrape it off. This is because it will ultimately fall off by itself, and is therefore not considered part of the body. As we have discussed above, scraping external items from the body is not included in memachek . However, if it will likely cause bleeding (because it is not completely dry or is not detached from the skin), one may not scrape it off, 1803 as doing so constitutes the melachos of shochet (slaughtering) and gozez (shearing). Warts may not be removed on Shabbos, as they are considered part of the body. 1804",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1799. Chazon Ish  52:16.

306,26/05/2026,MAAVIR AND MECHABEH (LIGHTING  AND EXTINGUISHING A FIRE),"Introduction Lighting a fire and extinguishing it were actions that were performed in the Mishkan, and constitute two separate melachos that are forbidden on Shabbos. We will discuss the halachos of both melachos simultaneously. Maavir is transgressed even if one creates a spark, and mechabeh is trans- gressed if one extinguishes a flame, regardless of its size. 1805 Types of Fire All types of fire are subject to this prohibition: candles, wicks in oil, gas flames, and incandescent bulbs are all included. 1806 • Striking a match constitutes maavir . • Using a magnifying glass to reflect the sun onto paper to burn it con- stitutes maavir . 1807 • Pushing in a cigarette lighter constitutes maavir . The Purpose As with all melachos , the Torah prohibitions of maavir and mechabeh are only transgressed when they are done for the same purpose as they were done in the Mishkan. The Torah prohibition for lighting a fire is transgressed as long as one intends to have a fire. But since the extinguishing in the Mishkan was done in order to make the coal or wick easier to light next time (not for the extinguishing of the flame itself), the Torah prohibition of extinguishing is only transgressed when doing so to fix or improve what was alight. Nevertheless, one transgresses maavir or mechabeh — at least Rabbinically — anytime he lights or extinguishes a fire, regardless of the purpose. 1808 In addition to lighting and extinguishing fires, we will see that there are many other practical applications, including regarding electricity, lights, heaters, and elevators.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1805.

307,27/05/2026,MAAVIR AND MECHABEH: IMPROVING  OR DIMINISHING FIRE,"We have seen that lighting or extinguishing a fire constitutes a prohibition, regardless of the size, type, or purpose of the fire. Adding and Removing Fuel Adding fuel to a fire and removing fuel from a fire also constitute the pro- hibition. 1809 • Adding oil to an oil lamp and removing oil from it are forbidden. Simi- larly, one may not bring oil closer to or farther from a fire. 1810 • Opening a gas container next to another one that is running on empty, as well as increasing or decreasing the gas flow to an existing flame, are forbidden. 1811 • Adding wood to a fire is forbidden. (Wood is also usually muktzeh .) Strengthening and Weakening Strengthening or weakening a fire without actually changing it constitutes a Torah prohibition. 1812 • One may not blow glowing coals so that they burst into flames. • One may not cover a fire to cut off the supply of oxygen and make it weaker. • One may not open a door where there is a breeze that will definitely strengthen the fire. 1813 Transferring Fire Transferring fire is the same as creating a new fire, and is likewise forbidden. • Using a lit candle to light a different one constitutes the Torah prohi- bition of maavir . Red-Hot Metal Causing metal to become red-hot — without making a flame — constitutes the Torah prohibition of maavir , as it possesses the ability to create fire. • If one forgot to put a blech (metal sheet to keep the heat covered) on before Shabbos, he may only do so if the metal will not get red-hot____ (see Days__ and__).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1809.

308,28/05/2026,MAAVIR AND MECHABEH: ELECTRICITY,"We have seen that lighting and extinguishing a fire constitute a Torah prohi- bition, regardless of the size, type, or purpose of the fire. This includes adding to or diminishing from a fire, transferring fire, and causing metal to become red-hot. There are three basic opinions regarding electricity on Shabbos. All rule that using electricity is forbidden; the dispute is only regarding the source and degree of the prohibition. 1815 Maavir (Lighting a Fire) Some Poskim hold that using electricity constitutes maavir , because the electric current generates heat. • As one turns on an incandescent light, the current causes the glowing filament inside the bulb to heat up, similar to heating up a metal until it is red-hot. 1816 Accordingly, disconnecting electricity would be considered mechabeh (ex- tinguishing fire). Boneh (Building) Some Poskim hold that an electric current is not Halachically considered fire. However, the Chazon Ish holds that because turning on electricity involves combining two ends of an electrical circuit, it constitutes boneh — putting to- gether two parts to form a unified, functional whole. 1817 • Switching on a light or an appliance involves closing an electric circuit that had been opened, causing the electricity to flow and the item to become functional. It is therefore forbidden. Accordingly, disconnecting electricity would be considered soser — dis- mantling a functional item. As mentioned, many Poskim do not agree with this, and prohibit use of electricity for other reasons. 1818 Molid (Creating) There is another view, 1819 which rules that electricity does not constitute a melachah . However, it is still prohibited Rabbinically, under a Rabbinic pro- hibition known as molid (creating). 1820 Examples of molid include spraying a garment with a fragrance, which is forbidden because it causes a creative change in the fabric. Similarly, crushing ice to get water is forbidden because it effects a creative change in the ice. Similarly, activating an appliance causes an electric charge which changes it from being a dormant object into an active one. The Poskim debate the strength of this leniency. 1821 The Consensus Practically speaking, electricity may not be turned on or off, or used in any way that causes the flow of the electricity to change. 1822 In cases of great need, one should consult a Rav , as there may be limited leniencies or cases where mitigating Halachic factors exist. However, the above applies only in cases where there is no heat being gen- erated. Where heat is being generated (such as by incandescent bulbs, heaters, and air conditioners), all agree that the Torah prohibition of maavir (or mech- abeh ) applies. In conclusion, one must assume that all electricity is forbidden. In very severe circumstances, one should consult a Rav .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1814. Ibid. 253:3.

309,29/05/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","We have seen that there are three potential issues with electricity: 1. Lighting or extinguishing a fire ( maavir or mechabeh ), such as the filaments in bulbs_. Making something functional by completing a circuit ( boneh ) or breaking it ( soser ), such as turning an electric switch on or off_. Making a creative change ( molid ), such as when turning on an ap- pliance In general, while many Poskim do not consider it a Torah prohibition of boneh , where there is heat, all agree that it constitutes the Torah prohibition of maavir . Even when there is no heat, putting electricity on or off on Shabbos is definitely at least Rabbinically prohibited. The New (NOT) Kosher Switch Recently, a new switch has been developed and marketed that delays the electric current that occurs when one activates a light or a plug. The major Poskim in the world today have come out strictly prohibiting such a device. 1823 First, such a delay is not good enough to change the act from being a melachah . 1824 Furthermore, even if such a device would technically be possible, it would still not be permissible, as the sole purpose of such a device is to turn Shabbos into a regular weekday, known as zilusa d’Shabbos . Therefore, it should be publicized that using such a device is strictly forbidden. Recorders Speaking into a tape recorder, MP3 player, or microphone is forbidden. This is because the sound of one’s voice generates electrical impulses. 1825 A microphone has the added prohibition of hashmaas kol — a Rabbinic decree against using objects to make sound on Shabbos. 1826 This is also a reason why one may not program a TV, radio, CD player, or other such device to remain or turn on on Shabbos. Phones As one lifts the receiver or presses “talk” to accept or make a call, a circuit is completed, causing a possible Torah prohibition. Speaking also sends electrical impulses, as we have discussed. Most cell phones and smartphones heat up as one uses them, and may even constitute the Torah prohibition of maavir . In a case of danger, one must do whatever is necessary to save a Jewish life, and therefore it is permitted to use the phone to call an emergency ser- vice. 1827 If one is certain that a delay will not compromise a person’s safety (but they are still in a life-threatening situation), he should use the phone abnormally. 1828 In a case of doubt, one must do whatever will save a life, without asking questions. Adjusting a Clock or Timer Even if a clock is already on, one may not change the time by pressing but- tons. This is because doing so constitutes the melachah of kosev (writing). The same applies to a digital timer. 1829",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1823. Letters published from Rav Chaim Kanievsky, Rav Yitzchak Berkovits, and Rav Yisrael  Belsky, and many others.

310,30/05/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","Elevators An elevator commonly possesses some of the issues regarding electricity. In many elevators, pressing a button causes a light to turn on. Moreover, boarding an elevator may indirectly cause more electricity to be used as the motor pulls a greater weight. Therefore, using an elevator on Shabbos is forbidden. 1830 “Shabbos Elevators” Some buildings (particularly buildings with observant Jews) have automatic elevators. These elevators automatically go up and down, stopping on every floor and opening for a set amount of time. The lights that flash will do so regardless of usage, 1831 so the issue of igniting fire does not apply. However, using the elevator may cause more electricity to be generated. In such cases, there are Halachic reasons to allow it, 1832 especially for ill, weak, or old people. It should be noted that the technology used differs from device to device, and these differences may affect the halachah. One may only be lenient when he knows the system and has consulted with a Rav . Some are stringent to only go up in such an elevator, but not down . This is because, ironically, there is a greater drain on the electricity when descending. While an elevator would naturally descend using gravity, the extra weight of the passenger is what causes a greater drain when stopping on each floor. 1833 In a place where Shabbos elevators are not commonly used, there is also an issue of maris ayin (the prohibition to do something that looks like it is for- bidden). 1834 In Conclusion If a person is ill, weak, 1835 pregnant, old, lives on or visits a very high floor, or needs to do a mitzvah , a Rav should be consulted before using a Shabbos elevator. 1836 In any case, one may only be lenient if he knows that the exact tech- nology of that particular model does not transgress any Shabbos prohibitions. 1837 Going in with a Non-Jew The same halachah applies when one goes into a regular elevator with a non-Jew who is going to the same floor. 1838 However, this is almost always a real problem of maris ayin , and is forbidden regardless. Going in with a Jew Who Does Not Keep Shabbos One may never benefit from a melachah of a Jew who transgresses Shabbos. Therefore, it is forbidden to use an elevator that is being operated by a Jew. Escalator It is permitted to go on an escalator. However, if it only starts moving because one stepped on it, it is forbidden to go on it. 1839",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1830.

311,31/05/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","Automatic Doors Directly causing an electric current for one’s benefit is forbidden. 1840 Be- cause motion or weight detectors immediately cause the doors to open when detecting a person, one may not use such doors on Shabbos. Similarly, walking in after someone else (i.e., a non-Jew) triggered the door is also forbidden, as one is interrupting the closing of the door and restarting the opening of the door. 1841 However, in a case of great need, such as when entering a hospital for treatment (not just to visit), there is reason to permit going in after a non-Jew. A Rav should be consulted. Obviously, one may not open electric doors using voice — or finger- print-recognition devices. 1842 Other Motion Detector-Enabled Devices One may not use faucets, urinals, blow-dryers, or paper-towel dispensers that turn on through the use of motion detectors. 1843 The same applies to motion sensor lights that go on as one walks near them. The use of these is even stricter than the other cases brought above, because they are lights, which may constitute maavir . If one knows for certain that there are lights that generate heat, one may not walk there under any circumstances. 1844 However, if one is not certain that there are such lights there, he need not take another route. If the area is already well lit, and one has no other option , some Poskim say that one may pass near the motion detector if necessary . 1845 Afterwards, one may walk away, even though the light will turn off. One may not ask a non-Jew to trigger a motion detector and illuminate the area. If a non-Jew has triggered it for his own benefit (or because he is passing by), one may walk there after him. Afterwards one may walk away, even though the light will eventually turn off and reactivate. 1846 House Alarm Sensors Many house alarm systems are equipped with motion sensors that detect movement in a room, causing a red light to flash. Walking into such a room may present a problem. Ideally, one should cover the sensor or disconnect it before Shabbos. If one did not, he may be lenient and walk through if necessary when the light is a small LED which does not produce heat and provides no real benefit (which it usually is). 1847 If the light is not an LED, one may not pass through.

312,01/06/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","Timers Although some are stringent not to use timers on Shabbos, most people rely on the lenient opinions. Therefore, one may set a timer before Shabbos to turn on and off during Shabbos without any human intervention. 1848 However, this is only true of devices that do not generate noise. 1849 • One may not set a dishwasher to go on over Shabbos, for two reasons. 1850 First, if closing the door of the dishwasher causes the timer to activate, one has a major part in the electricity that follows. Second, it generates quite a bit of noise, which is Rabbinically prohibited. 1851 The same ap- plies to washing machines. The latter reason applies to radios and the like as well. • One may set lights, a hot plate, a heater, or an air conditioner before Shabbos to go on or off over Shabbos. • One may set a generator before Shabbos to go on and off over Shabbos. 1852 Adjusting Timers on Shabbos Any digital timer may not be adjusted on Shabbos under any circumstances, as it directly affects the electric current, and may also involve digital writing. 1853 In general, indirectly causing a melachah ( grama ) is prohibited, unless one will otherwise suffer a major loss. 1854 Therefore, adjusting a manual timer to cause more or less electricity is forbidden. 1855 • One may not adjust a timer on a hot plate so that it will turn on or off in an hour. 1856 However, in cases where any changes will not have any direct electric con- sequences (such as a light flashing momentarily), it may be permitted in specific cases in extenuating circumstances. A Rav should be consulted before availing oneself of these leniencies. Note that not all manual timers function in a way that these leniencies apply. Prolonging a Melachah One may be permitted to extend a situation for longer (by pressing down the tabs that follow the current setting), provided that a melachah is not being performed. 1857 According to some opinions, one should only rely on this leniency in cases of great need, 1858 as many Poskim prohibit adjustments altogether. 1859 It follows that when a manual timer (not a digital one) is set to turn an appli- ance off, one may be permitted to adjust it so that it turns off at a later time. 1860 A Rav should be consulted. • If the light is set to turn off at ten, one may be permitted to flick the immediate tabs that follow so that it only turns off at eleven. The same is true regarding an appliance that is currently off, and a manual timer is set to turn it on. One may be permitted to adjust it so that it turns on at a later time. A Rav should be consulted. • If the light is set to turn on at five, one may be permitted to flick the immediate tabs that follow so that it only turns on at six. Causing a Melachah to Occur Earlier But one may not cause a melachah to occur earlier than it was originally set to occur. Therefore, if a timer is set to turn an appliance off in two hours, one may not adjust it so that it turns off in one hour. (Under extreme circumstances, it may be permitted. A Rav should be consulted. 1861 ) • If the light is set to turn off at eleven, one may not flick the earlier tabs so that it turns off at ten. Preventing a Timer from Activating According to some Poskim , if the power is currently off (whether due to an outage or it having being set to go off) and one does not want the light or appliance to turn on when the power turns on as it is set to, one may remove the timer from the socket with a shinui (abnormally), 1862 such as with his elbow. This is only permitted if the power is off. • According to some Poskim , if the power got cut off, one may remove the whole plug from the socket using his elbow so that when the power is restored at_:00 a.m., the lights and hot plate won’t come on. Yom Tov On Yom Tov, one may cause electricity to turn on earlier (as transferring fire for cooking is permitted on Yom Tov), but one may generally not cause it to turn off earlier. 1863 A Rav should be consulted. 1864 The different permutations of these halachos can be quite confusing, espe- cially in stressful situations. It is best to consult a Rav before adjusting any timer.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1848. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  13:26.

313,02/06/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","Cars Driving a car involves abundant transgressions of maavir : as one turns the key, the spark plugs ignite, and every time one accelerates, he releases gasoline into the cylinders, where it is consumed for fuel (burned). Both igniting sparks and burning up fuel constitute maavir . A person who drives a car is transgress- ing Shabbos thousands of times per minute, as over_,000 sparks are generated every minute. Furthermore, the more powerful the engine and the faster one drives, the more times Shabbos is being transgressed. Obviously, driving a car on Shabbos is forbidden. There are times when traveling in a car is necessary, such as when a person’s life is in danger (see Days___—289 and___). Batteries In certain ways, batteries have the same status as electricity. Even if there are no lights or heat, the Rabbinic problem of molid (creating) still applies. 1865 According to some Poskim , the Torah prohibition of boneh — completing a circuit to create a new vessel — also applies. Therefore, one may not turn on a battery-operated appliance on Shabbos. In general, such appliances are also muktzeh , and may not be moved on Shabbos, unless one needs to use the space that they are occupying or one is using them for a different, permissible use____ (see Day___ for more details). • One may not turn on a battery-operated flashlight (even if it is LED), watch, calculator, fan, or toy on Shabbos. One may not move any of these unless he needs the space that it is occupying or he needs the flashlight to see (if it was already on from before Shabbos) or the fan to blow in a more desirable direction (if it was turned on from before Shabbos). 1867 Hearing Aids Wearing a hearing aid is not an issue, no different from a wrist watch, pro- vided that it does not need to be activated or adjusted on Shabbos. 1868 If it must be activated or adjusted, one may be able to do so if there are no heat-based lights. One should consult an expert on hearing aids and a Rav beforehand. One may not change the battery, but he may hint to a non-Jew to change it for him (see Day___ for more details). One may wear a hearing aid in a reshus harabim or a karmelis that has no eiruv , as it does not constitute carrying. A bigger problem is actually regarding the one speaking to the person who is wearing the hearing aid, as it is similar to using a battery-operated microphone! However, a person who is hard of hearing is considered “ill” and “needy” in this regard, 1869 and so, the Rabbinic prohibition is waived for them, if necessary. 1870 However, if speaking into the hearing aids will cause non-LED lights to flash, it is better to avoid doing so.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1865.

314,03/06/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","We have seen that there are three potential issues with electricity: 1. Lighting or extinguishing a fire ( maavir or mechabeh ), such as the filaments in bulbs_. Making something functional by completing a circuit ( boneh ) or breaking it ( soser ), such as flipping an electric switch_. Making a creative change ( molid ), such as when turning on an ap- pliance In general, although many Poskim do not consider it boneh , when there is heat, all agree that it constitutes the Torah prohibition of maavir . Even if there is no heat, putting electricity on or off on Shabbos is definitely at least Rabbin- ically prohibited. Electric Sensors Many driveway gates have a pedestrian gate through which people walk in and out on Shabbos. However, there is a sensor that clicks every time someone passes, causing some electricity to be generated. Because there is no heat (even the light is an LED), it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, and there may be leniencies, such as in the following cases. 1871 If one is doing a mitzvah, such as when walking to or from shul, one may walk past such a sensor. Likewise, it is also permitted if there is a pressing need, such as retrieving a child who has wandered outside the gate. Moreover, even if there is no specific mitzvah or pressing need to pass, one may pass by with a shinui , that is, change the way that he walks. 1872 This can be accomplished by jumping or walking sideways or backwards as one passes the sensor. 1873 It is praiseworthy to be stringent and cover the “eye” of the sensor before Shabbos, so that one need not rely on these leniencies. Alternatively, if there is a different way to pass that does not involve a sensor, it is best to use that one. Hotel Doors Today, most hotels give clients a card that activates the door to their room, thus making an active change in the functionality of the door, constituting a Rabbinic prohibition. Therefore, one may not use a hotel key card on Shabbos. (For solutions, see Day___.) Car Alarms It is true that ringing car alarms are extremely annoying. However, switching them off involves using a battery — a Rabbinic prohibition. One may hint to a non-Jew to turn the alarm off. 1874 In cases where it is creating a major disturbance (such as disturbing the neighbors’ sleep), one may even ask a non-Jew straight out to turn it off. 1875",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1871. There are two Rabbinic prohibitions — according to many  Poskim , putting on and off  electricity is Rabbinic, and it is a case of a  psik reisha d’lo nicha lei . Therefore, for the sake of a  mitzvah or pressing need, it is permitted.

315,04/06/2026,"MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  ELECTRICITY, CONTINUED","Refrigerators____ The Motor Many refrigerators run on a thermostat. Every time one opens the door, warm air rushes in and raises the temperature, causing the motor to adjust its function. Some Poskim say that one must disconnect the thermostat and keep the motor on a timer, so that opening and closing the door will have no effect. 1877 Other Poskim say that one should only open the door when the motor is running. 1878 There are other Poskim who allow one to open the door regardless. 1879 It is advisable to only open the refrigerator while the motor is running. 1880 The Light One may not open or close a refrigerator door if the refrigerator has a light that turns on while the door is open. 1881 One should remove the light (or tape down the switch that causes it to turn on) before Shabbos. If he did not, some Poskim allow one to get a non-Jew to open and close the refrigerator, but only for essential Shabbos needs. 1882 In addition, if a non-Jew will not be constantly available, one can ask a non-Jew to remove the light. If one is uncertain whether he removed the light before Shabbos, some Poskim allow him to open it. If one opened a refrigerator and realized that the light has indeed not been removed, the food inside is still permitted. But he may not close it. Rather, he should ask a non-Jew to do so. 1883 The Fan In some modern refrigerators, a fan turns off when the door is opened. One must tape the switch or remove the function before Shabbos. (This may be the same switch as the one that controls the light.) This may require a magnet on the door or the sensor to block the fan switch, or it may require a professional. If one did not do so, some Poskim allow him to get a non-Jew to open the refrigerator for essential Shabbos needs. Ice Defrosters and Digital Chips If, as one opens the door, the ice defroster turns on, or the digital chip im- mediately adjusts, it is forbidden to open or close the door according to all au- thorities. This is particularly problematic in modern refrigerators and freezers. One must clarify this and remove this function before Shabbos. If one did not, according to some Poskim , he may get a non-Jew to open and close the refrigerator or freezer for him, but only for essential Shabbos needs. 1884 It is worth mentioning that there are particular organizations that special- ize in adjusting appliances in order to avoid Shabbos desecration. One should consult a Rav for more information. Ovens The Thermostat An oven usually has a thermostat which regulates the temperature. Similar to a refrigerator, as one opens the oven door, cold air comes in and the temperature drops. The thermostat then causes more heat to be generated, and restores the oven to the required temperature. If one left food in the oven before Shabbos, he may only remove it while the motor or the light indicate that the oven is heating up. 1885 (See Day__ regarding leaving food in the oven before Shabbos.) However, some opinions hold that one may remove it at any stage, even if the motor is not running. In cases of need, one may rely on this. 1886 Cooking One may never close the door to an oven on Shabbos if the food that re- mains inside is not fully cooked. This constitutes the Torah prohibition of bishul (cooking). Functions That Trigger When the Door Opens or Closes If any electrical change takes place immediately as one opens or closes the door (such as a fan, digital chip, or light getting activated), one may not open or close the oven. In cases of extreme need, one may ask a non-Jew to do so.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1876. Based on  Mishnah Berurah  277:9.

In this way, one avoids benefiting from the melachah . • Food that was at least one-third cooked, and was heated on a covered stove or hot plate, may be eaten on Shabbos while warm. 1894 • Food that was not one-third cooked before the power went out may not be eaten on Shabbos. 1895 In cases of extreme need, one should consult a Rav . 1896 Note that in the event that the main Shabbos meal that was already fully cooked was left on a covered stove or hot plate, not only may one eat it (even if it is a liquid), but he may even ask a non-Jew to restore the power. 1897 If the non-Jew Caused the Power Outage If the non-Jew himself caused the power outage, and restores the power on his own to make up for his error, one may be lenient and benefit from the melachah . 1898 (The non-Jew is doing so to avoid a negative reaction from those whom he affected, and this is called doing a melachah for his own benefit.) • If the non-Jewish neighbor put a wet plug into a socket, causing the fuse to blow for the entire building, one need not prevent him from restoring the power of his own free will, and he may benefit from his actions.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1887.

317,06/06/2026,MAAVIR AND MECHABEH:  APPLICATIONS OF MECHABEH,"Most of our discussion so far has related to creating fire. We will now con- sider a few applications of extinguishing fire — the opposite melachah . Preparing Wicks We have mentioned that the husband should play a part in the mitzvah of Shabbos lights (see Day__). One of the ways of doing so is to light the wicks and extinguish them beforehand, so that it will be easier for the wicks to catch fire when his wife is lighting. This is a classic example of the Torah melachah of mechabeh if performed on Shabbos, as one is extinguishing for a constructive purpose. That said, any extinguishing is at least Rabbinically prohibited, even if it not for a constructive purpose. Diminishing a Flame Not only is completely extinguishing a flame forbidden, diminishing it also constitutes mechabeh . 1899 • One may not lower the flame on a gas range. (Note that if the flame went out, one may shut the gas valve with a shinui .) • One may not open a door or window that will definitely cause a wind to adversely affect a flame. This is particularly relevant on Chanukah, when we light near doors or windows. 1900 Diminishing Electricity As mentioned, many appliances and electric lights (filament based) are con- sidered fire. It follows that causing the electric current to diminish constitutes the Torah melachah of mechabeh . • Dimming the lights constitutes mechabeh . • Lowering the settings on a heater or refrigerator constitutes mechabeh . Even when there is no heat involved, but there is an electric current, one may not adjust the settings. • One may not change the strength of a fan from one level to another. However, one may use the oscillating knob to ensure that it only blows in one direction (or to allow it to blow in all directions), as that function is purely mechanical and not in any way electrical. 1901",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1899.

318,07/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH (LIFE- THREATENING SITUATIONS),"Introduction Until now, we have covered the main practical applications of the thirty-nine melachos (forbidden activities) of Shabbos. There are still a number of important topics to discuss. Transgressing Shabbos to Save a Life The Torah says, “These are the mitzvos that you shall do, and live by them.” 1902 Chazal explain that we must live while doing mitzvos, and we may not cause ourselves to die while doing mitzvos. 1903 (In general, there are only three exceptions: we are required to give up our lives rather than transgress the three cardinal sins: killing, worshipping false gods, and committing adultery, and in certain cases for kiddush Hashem .) Therefore, although transgressing Shabbos has the severest of consequences, it must nevertheless be transgressed if a Jewish life is threatened. A Mitzvah It is not only permitted and required to transgress Shabbos to save the life of a Jew, it is considered a great mitzvah. 1904 When in Doubt, Act One must transgress Shabbos even if one is uncertain if his efforts will be successful, and even if he is uncertain that it is a life-threatening situation. The moment that there is a possible danger, one must transgress Shabbos. The prin- ciple is: save now and ask later. Even if it turned out that one’s actions were not required or were unsuccessful, it remains a mitzvah , and is certainly not considered an aveirah . 1905 A Moment of Life One must transgress Shabbos in order to save a life, even if the person will only live for a few more moments. 1906 Similarly, even if a person is terminally ill and likely to die soon anyway, one must nevertheless transgress Shabbos to save his life. Repentance A person need not repent for transgressing Shabbos in an attempt to save a Jew. Rather, he has done a great mitzvah , even if the Jew did not survive and even if his intervention was not necessary in the end. 1907",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1902. Vayikra  18:5.

319,08/06/2026,"PIKUACH NEFESH, CONTINUED","Who Should Transgress Shabbos to Save a Jewish Life? The quickest and most efficient method should always be used when saving a Jewish life, even if Shabbos must be transgressed. However, if one can save the life just as quickly, effectively, and efficiently without transgressing Shabbos, he may not transgress Shabbos. Obviously, when in doubt, act first and ask questions later. 1908 When all other factors are equal, it is better for a great sage or Rabbi to transgress Shabbos in order to save a life, rather than a layman, woman, child, or non-Jew. 1909 This is because a Jewish life is very precious, and it is a privilege to save it. Onlookers will learn that one must never hesitate to save a life, even on Shabbos. Non-Jews In general, one may not transgress Shabbos to save the life of a non-Jew. 1910 However, in most situations, it will cause ill will if a Jew is less than enthusiastic. Whenever this is the case, one may certainly transgress a Rabbinic prohibition to save him. 1911 In situations where not saving a non-Jew may cause Jewish lives to be endangered, one must save him even by transgressing a Torah prohibition. 1912 One should consult a Rav if necessary. Irreligious Jews: Rebellious or Ignorant There is much discussion among the Poskim about the permissibility of saving the life, even on a weekday, of a Jew who has intentionally rebelled against Hashem and publicly rejects mitzvos in order to anger Him. 1913 Furthermore, the possible leniencies that apply to saving a non-Jew to avoid ill will or danger also apply to a rebellious Jew. However, if he is merely ignorant or has succumbed to his desires, or would repent in the face of such a mortal danger, one must certainly save him, even on Shabbos. 1914 Thus, in almost all cases, one must save the life of a Jew, even if he does not yet fulfill the mitzvos. When in doubt regarding his status, act now and ask later. Infants and Fetuses One must transgress Shabbos to save the life of a one-day-old baby, 1915 and even to save the life of a fetus. 1916 The same applies to a mentally handicapped person (who may not be obligated in mitzvos) or a terminally ill patient. One Who Does Not Want to Be Saved Even if the person does not wish to be saved, one is still obligated to save him. 1917 Life-Threatening in the Future One must act to prevent a person from entering a life-threatening situation in the future, even if his life is not currently in danger. 1918 • If a person suffered a snake bite that over a few hours will cause death, one must do whatever is necessary now to save his life, even though right now he is not actually in danger. Doctors and Patients When one does not know if there is a danger to life, and a doctor is available, he should ask the doctor. If a patient himself says that he is in danger, one must believe him even if the doctor says otherwise, and transgress Shabbos to save him. 1919 If there is no doctor and the patient does not know whether he is in danger, it is a case of doubt, and one must save now and ask later. Life-Threatening Illness That Is Treatable Even when a person takes medicine that successfully treats his life-threaten- ing illness, he is still considered in danger, and if necessary, one must transgress Shabbos to save him. 1920 • A person who has angina is considered to have a life-threatening illness, even though it is treatable. Enabling Sleep If a person in danger needs to rest and a light is disturbing him, one must turn it off, unless he can cover it or move it. 1921 This is because sleep is a neces- sary part of healing.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1908.

320,09/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH:  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS,"The following are examples of possible life-threatening situations in which Shabbos must be transgressed (if necessary), unless a doctor has advised that it is not a life-threatening situation. 1922 • Abnormally high temperature accompanied by great discomfort with- out any apparent reason, before a doctor has explained it • Very high temperature in the elderly or children • Internal bleeding • A suspected broken bone in major organs, especially the skull or spine, or near any internal organ • A stabbing or any sharp item that has deeply pierced the body. (Note that tetanus shots can be administered a number of hours after such an event, and may not necessarily require transgressing Shabbos.) • The severing of a vein, such as on the wrist • Serious burns. It is irrelevant if it was caused by fire, the sun, or chem- icals. • A bee or other insect sting to one who is or may be allergic • A bite from a dog, snake, scorpion, or other poisonous or possibly rabid animal • Consumption of a dangerous amount of detergent, medicine, or other poisonous substance • Concussion or loss of consciousness due to a major fall or shock • Unexpected difficulty breathing, seeing, or speaking • Irregular heart trouble All the above cases should be considered life-threatening, and Shabbos should be transgressed to treat such situations, until a doctor has determined that the person’s life is not threatened. Although some of these cases are not yet dangerous, but may be either a sign of danger or lead to danger, one must transgress Shabbos unless he is certain that there is no need to do so.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,1922.

321,10/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH: PREGNANT WOMEN,"Taking Medicine A pregnant woman who needs to take medicine because of a concern for her health or the health of her baby should ideally avoid taking it on Shabbos. If it is possible, she should take the medication just before and just after Shabbos. However, if that is not possible, she may take it on Shabbos. 1923 (Taking medicine is generally Rabbinically prohibited [see Day___].) However, she should only take those medications that are related to her pregnancy, and not to cure a mild headache or the like. The Life of a Fetus As mentioned previously, one must transgress Shabbos (if necessary) even to save the life of a fetus that is less than forty days old. 1924 Therefore, if a pregnant woman is bleeding, she should consult a doctor and a Rav to determine if it is a life-threatening situation for her or the fetus. As we have mentioned, if a doctor is not easily available and there is an uncertainty regarding whether or not it is dangerous, the rule is act now and ask later.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1923.

322,11/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH: CHILDBIRTH,"A woman who is giving birth is considered to be in a life-threatening situa- tion during the birth and for seventy-two hours afterwards. 1925 Therefore, one can transgress Shabbos to save her, if necessary. However, it is better to perform any necessary melachos in an abnormal manner ( shinui ) unless the resulting delay will be harmful to her. 1926 DEFINING ""DURING CHILDBIRTH"" According to Chazal , “birth” begins when a woman needs help to walk, or when the blood is flowing steadily, or when she sits on the birthing chair. 1927 From any of these points, she is considered to be in a life-threatening situation, and Shabbos may be transgressed, if necessary, to get her to a hospital. However, because one is permitted to desecrate Shabbos to avoid imminent danger, she is permitted to go to the hospital once her contractions are between fifteen and twenty minutes apart. However, once she has arrived, Shabbos may not be transgressed on her behalf until she needs help to walk, her blood is flowing steadily, or she is ready to deliver. 1928 Additionally, once her waters break, she may go to the hospital even if she has not experienced contractions. Again, when transgressing Shabbos, one should preferably do so in an ab- normal manner ( shinui ) unless it will cause a harmful delay. Preparations One should prepare the bags that she will need in the hospital before Shab- bos. If she will go in a specific car, she should load the car with the bags before- hand. This will avoid extra melachos as well as moving muktzeh items. 1929 One need not arrange to sleep close to a hospital on Shabbos night when she is due, so as to avoid transgressing Shabbos should she go into labor. 1930 Who Drives Driving constitutes multiple transgressions of the melachah of maavir (light- ing a fire) every time one touches the accelerator. Therefore, one should ideally get a non-Jewish driver or taxi. It is preferable to pay in advance or prepare the money before Shabbos, or to arrange to pay the driver after Shabbos. However, if this was not done, one may take money along. 1931 If the non-Jewish driver will take too long to arrive, a Jew must drive.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1925.

323,12/06/2026,"PIKUACH NEFESH:  CHILDBIRTH, CONTINUED","Turning Off the Car and Opening and Closing the Doors If a Jew drove, he should hint to a non-Jew as much as possible to per- form as many of the melachos and Rabbinic prohibitions that are involved when leaving the car as possible. These can include switching off the ignition, locking the car (if there are any electrical results of doing so), opening and closing the car doors (due to the lights turning on and off), and turning the car lights on and off. If a non-Jew is not available, a Jew can only do so if leaving the car on presents a danger, such as children entering it to play or a danger that it will explode — but even then, he should preferably perform these acts only with a shinui . 1932 Using a Phone If one needs to call a doctor, ambulance, or doula (birth coach), he should ask the following people to do so, in this order of preference: a non-Jew, a child who is not his own, his own child with a shinui , and oneself with a shinui . 1933 Who Travels with Her The woman giving birth is permitted to take along one person to accom- pany her to the hospital so that she will be at ease. 1934 This may be the husband, a doula, or some other relative. If she needs more than one person, she should consult a Rav . (Note that the husband may not view the actual birth, since a woman be- comes a niddah during childbirth, and he may not see his wife unclothed while she is a niddah . Therefore, if the husband accompanies his wife to the hospital, he should preferably sit not facing his wife.) Hospital Doors and Elevators Ideally, one should wait for someone else to open the electric doors of the hospital, and walk in after them, unless such a delay will cause harm. (This is in any case only permitted in a life-threatening situation.) If there is no time, one may walk through normally. 1935 The same applies to an elevator, if she will not manage the stairs. Waiting in the Hospital If it was a false alarm, and the hospital staff say that she should go home, she may not transgress Shabbos in order to do so. If she feels great discomfort or has no place near the hospital where she could remain until after Shabbos, her status becomes “a sick person who is not in danger,” and some Poskim rule that she may go home using a non-Jewish driver.

324,13/06/2026,"PIKUACH NEFESH:  CHILDBIRTH, CONTINUED","Seventy-Two Hours For seventy-two hours after a woman has given birth, she is Halachical- ly considered “in danger.” Therefore, one may transgress Shabbos during that time if she or the doctor says that it is necessary. 1937 As we have mentioned, one must always try to limit the severity of the transgression of Shabbos by doing so with a shinui , provided that it does not compromise the speed and efficiency of treatment. 1938 • If a woman who has just given birth needs hot water, one may boil hot water for her if there is no hot water available and no non-Jew is available to boil it. If the woman and her doctor say that there is no need to transgress Shabbos, one may not do so. 1939 The First Week After the first seventy-two hours, one may still transgress Shabbos for the duration of the week — four more days, if she herself agrees that she needs it. But if the doctor says that she needs a melachah performed for her, and she does not feel that it is necessary, Shabbos may not be transgressed. However, if she is silent or she agrees with the doctor, one must transgress Shabbos on her behalf. 1940 The First Month Until the thirtieth day after birth, she is considered “ill.” We will see that one may ask a non-Jew to perform a melachah for one who is ill but not in danger, if necessary. 1941 If a non-Jew is not available, a Jew may perform a Rabbinic prohi- bition for such a person with a shinui (abnormally). 1942 Obviously, if she is in possible danger at any stage, the usual rules of pikuach nefesh apply, and one must transgress Shabbos to save her life if it is necessary. Caesarian Section A woman who gave birth via a caesarian section has at least those same leniencies that apply to a natural birth. 1943 Moreover, if the doctor says that she needs a melachah performed for her after the first seventy-two hours, we listen to the doctor even if she does not feel that she needs it, until the doctor says that she is no longer in the category of pikuach nefesh . 1944 Miscarriages and Stillborns A woman who had a miscarriage or stillbirth (may Hashem have mercy on her) has the same rules as a woman who gave birth to a live baby, provided that the fetus was more than forty days old. 1945 Planning a Birth One should not plan a caesarian section for Shabbos, or even Friday or Thursday. Rather, she should plan it for the beginning of the week. Needless to say, if there is any danger to the mother or child, an emergency caesarian section may be performed whenever necessary, including Shabbos. 1946 Furthermore, one should not induce a woman on a Friday afternoon or on Shabbos, as it will obviously lead to Shabbos transgressions. Again, if delaying the birth has the possibility of danger to the woman or fetus, one must induce whenever is necessary. Lighting Shabbos Candles A woman who has given birth is still obligated in the mitzvah of Shabbos lights. If possible, she should light where she will eat____ or sleep. 1948 If that is not possible or the hospital staff will move the candles afterwards (rendering her blessing a brachah l’vatalah ), she can fulfill the mitzvah through her daughters____ or husband who will light at her home, 1950 but she must still enjoy some light wherever she is. If that is also not possible, she can switch the electric lights off and then on, and then make the brachah . 1951 Under no circumstances should she light in a lobby or in a place where the hospital staff will move her candles.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1937.

325,14/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH: FIRE,"Danger or Possible Danger As we have mentioned numerous times, if there is any danger to one’s life, or even a possibility of such danger, one must transgress Shabbos if it is needed. Therefore, if a fire breaks out in a house and there is even the slightest chance that a Jew will not escape in time____ (such as an elderly person or an infant), one must do everything necessary to prevent it, including putting out the fire or calling the fire department. 1953 Spreading Fires Even if a fire is in an apartment where there are no people, one must put it out if it may spread to a different apartment where there may be people who will be unable to escape. This is also true if a house is on fire, and it may spread to a nearby house where people may not be able to escape. 1954 No Danger If a fire breaks out in a house and all of the people have safely exited, one may not transgress Shabbos further unless it will spread and cause danger. Moreover, one may not remove any possessions (even non- muktzeh items) to a different domain, even if there is an eiruv , except for clothing that he puts on, and food that he needs for any upcoming Shabbos meals. One may also take out any items that have holy words, such as Sifrei Torah , sefarim , and tefillin. However, one may not take off mezuzos from the walls. 1955 The reason that items may not be removed (aside for the listed exceptions) is that Chazal understood that one may become overwhelmed from the potential loss, and come to transgress Shabbos by putting out the fire. However, there are a few leniencies: • Chazal only forbade bringing possessions to a different domain, such as a karmelis or a reshus harabim . One may remove any items, even if they are muktzeh , to a private garden or anywhere under the same roof, such as a stairwell or a different apartment. 1956 • The prohibition of removing items is once the fire has arrived. But if a fire has not yet arrived at a room or house, one may remove any valuable items (even if they are muktzeh ) to prevent them from being destroyed in the event that the fire arrives. 1957 The same applies if robbers are approaching. However, one may not move muktzeh items to protect them from the rain. 1958 This leniency only applies to a fire that has not yet arrived in that room or area. • Even if one person has saved food for his family, anyone else who is present can go and bring out the same amount. Furthermore, even if a person has enough for his Shabbos meals, he can still go back and bring food of a different type or taste. • The limitation of taking Shabbos meals applies to small bags or contain- ers. Once one has begun using a large container (such as a stroller or sack), he may fill it with food to capacity (even beyond what is necessary for the Shabbos meal). 1959 • One can remove as many drinks as he wants, 1960 as a person is always likely to need a drink. 1961 • One may wear as many clothes as he wishes to, layering them one on top of the other. 1962 • Others who are present (friends, family, or neighbors) may also go and take food and clothing for themselves using the same guidelines. 1963 However, the owner may not explicitly ask them to save things. 1964 • As mentioned, one must try to save any holy works, such as Sifrei Torah , siddurim, sefarim , and tefillin.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1952.

326,15/06/2026,"PIKUACH NEFESH: FIRE, CONTINUED","Calling Non-Jews to Save Possessions Asking a non-Jew to do a melachah constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. Be- cause extinguishing a fire constitutes the melachah of mechabeh , one may not directly ask a non-Jew to put out a fire to save his possessions. (As we have discussed, one may certainly enlist a non-Jew to help put out a fire that presents a danger to a Jewish life.) However, a few leniencies apply: • One may show a non-Jew the fire and hint to him, saying, “Whoever puts out the fire will not lose out,” or, “Whoever calls the fire depart- ment will benefit.” 1965 • Benefiting from a melachah done by a non-Jew is forbidden. One is generally required to protest, even if a non-Jew comes to do a melachah for one’s benefit on his own accord. However, if a non-Jew comes on his own accord to save the Jew’s possessions, the Jew need not protest. 1966 • If a fire breaks out in one’s non-Jewish neighbor’s house, one may alert him, even if his intent is to prevent the fire from spreading to his own house. 1967 • One may explicitly instruct a non-Jew to save holy items such as tefillin, sefarim , and mezuzos. 1968 Causing a Fire to Be Extinguished Although we have seen that one may not extinguish a fire merely to save possessions (unless it is life-threatening), one may indirectly cause a fire to go out in the face of a potential major loss. That is, one may put in place a situation through which the fire will passively be extinguished by itself. 1969 • If the carpet catches fire, one may place bottles of water around the fire, so that the water will put it out when the fire arrives. • If a bookshelf catches fire on one side, one may pour water on the other side to prevent the fire from destroying the whole thing. (One may not pour water that will flow directly to where the fire is, rather only in a place where the fire will reach the water.) • If a tablecloth catches fire, one may not pour water on the other side or around the fire, because doing so is considered cleaning it, and consti- tutes the melachah of melaben . However, one may pour a colored liquid around it so that the fire will not spread. 1970 Moving Candles Candles that are alight are muktzeh , and may not be moved on Shabbos. If one left candles on a table and needs the space, he may ask a non-Jew to move them. 1971 If candles fell onto the tablecloth and no non-Jews are available to prevent further damage, one should gently move the tablecloth towards the floor and shake the candles onto the nonflammable floor. 1972 If doing so will cause damage to valuables, one can remove them normally, placing them in a place where they will not be extinguished. 1973 Again, one may never directly extinguish a fire unless there is a possible danger to life.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1965.

327,16/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH:  DANGEROUS SITUATIONS,"There are other cases that may constitute danger, and one may have to trans- gress Shabbos if it becomes necessary and a Jewish life is in danger. Live Wires If there is a live wire in a house, and there is a concern that it may trigger a fire or fatal electric shock, one should ideally avoid the house during Shabbos. If that is not possible (such as when there are elderly or sick people that are not able to move), one may turn off the electricity, preferably with a shinui (abnormally). If that is not possible or if that itself is dangerous, one may call an electrician or relevant agency, preferably with a shinui (abnormally). 1974 One may also call the responsible agency in the event that the live wire is in a public place, if it represents a danger to the public. 1975 This is only where a possible danger to life is present. One may not transgress Shabbos merely to save one’s possessions . Dangerous or Rabid Animals Although trapping and killing constitute melachos , one may trap or kill any animal that presents a danger to the life of a Jew. Therefore, a rabid dog (or even one that may have rabies) may be trapped or killed. Similarly, a snake may be trapped or killed if it is likely to present a danger to people, even if one is not yet certain that it is poisonous. 1976 (See our more lengthy discussions of this topic in tzad [trapping] [Day___] and shochet [drawing blood] [Day___] for more details.) Robbers and Terrorists If robbers have broken into a house, one should run away, if possible. If that is not possible, one may call the police, as a danger to life exists. The same certainly applies to terrorists. However, if the robbers are clearly not armed and unlikely to murder, one may not transgress Shabbos to call the police. Indeed, one is required to give up all of his possessions to avoid transgressing Shabbos when un- necessary. 1977 As always, if one is uncertain if a danger to Jewish life is present, he must do whatever is necessary to save the life, and determine the facts at a later point. Fights If there is a fight and a Jew may get killed, one must do whatever is necessary to save him, even if it means transgressing Shabbos. A Missing Child If a child has gone missing, one must call the authorities immediately, as this situation presents a clear danger to the life of the child.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1974.

328,17/06/2026,PIKUACH NEFESH:  RETURNING FROM EMERGENCIES;   MISCELLANEOUS,"If a person transgressed Shabbos in order to save a life and had to travel to a distant location, certain leniencies apply regarding returning to his place of origin. Although he may no longer transgress an outright Torah prohibition, certain Rabbinic prohibitions are waived. Chazal understood that people may hesitate to save a life if they were not allowed some leeway afterwards. 1978 These leniencies apply even if it emerged that attempting to save the life was unnecessary, and even if the life was not saved, God forbid. Driving Home A person who transgressed Shabbos in order to save a Jew may not drive home afterwards. 1979 He may, however, get a ride from a non-Jew. 1980 He must be certain not to use anything in the car that is electrical or has electrical conse- quences, such as doors, windows, and lights. As mentioned previously, a woman who was told that she can leave the hospital as the birth is still far off may not transgress Shabbos to go home. If she feels great discomfort or has no place to remain until after Shabbos, her status becomes “a sick person who is not in danger,” and according to some Poskim , she may go home with a non-Jewish driver. She should preferably consult a Rav . Ambulance Drivers, Hatzolah Volunteers, and Doctors A medical professional who transgressed Shabbos in order to save a Jew may only drive home if there is a logical possibility that he may be required in his home area. However, if there are enough accessible medical personnel in his home area, he may not drive home. However, he may get a ride from a non-Jew, following the guidelines that we discussed above. 1981 Returning to the City There is a Rabbinic prohibition to travel (even by foot) beyond_,000 amos (0.6 miles/960 meters) from the last inhabited area of a city. This is known as techumim (borders) — see Day___. A person who left the city to save a Jew may only travel (even by foot) with- in a_.6 mile/960 meter radius of the place of the emergency. Even if there is a non-Jew available to give him a car ride, he may not travel_.6 miles/960 meters further from where he tried to save the person. Obviously, if it is dangerous to remain in such a remote place, one may even transgress a Torah prohibition if it is necessary to get himself back to safety. This prohibition applies to unin- habited areas. A person may return to his place of origin if he is still inside the (inhabited) city. 1982 Saving a Jewish Soul There are times that one must transgress Shabbos to save a Jewish soul . If a Jew is being enticed by idol worship or by other religions (such as being captured by missionaries), there are times that one must transgress Shabbos to save him. However, because every case needs to be considered individually, one may not do anything before consulting with a Rav . 1983",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1978. Eiruvin  44b.

329,18/06/2026,REFUAH (HEALING),"No Danger to Life Until now, we have dealt with pikuach nefesh — transgressing Torah prohi- bitions if it is necessary to save a Jewish life. We will now discuss the halachos of treating situations that are definitely not life-threatening. If there is no danger, one may not transgress a Torah prohibition to treat a person. However, if there is still significant illness or pain, certain Rabbinic prohibitions may be waived, such as getting a non-Jew to do melachos for a Jew, or doing melachos with a shinui (abnormally). We will discuss these concepts in detail. There are four basic categories of non-life-threatening situations, in which certain Rabbinic prohibitions may be waived: Serious But Not Life-Threatening • Sakanas eiver (danger to a limb): A person is not (necessarily) ill, but a muscle or limb of his body is in danger, and it is not a danger to his life. • Choleh she’ein bo sakanah (a person who is ill but whose life is not in danger): A person who is in so much pain or so ill that he needs bed rest, or a person whose entire body is in pain. In the above two cases, one may ask a non-Jew to do melachos to treat him or benefit him. 1984 If that is not possible, a Jew may transgress Rabbinic prohibitions with a shinui (abnormally) in order to treat him. If there is sakanas eiver (danger to a limb), and a non-Jew is not available, a Jew may transgress a Rabbinic pro- hibition even without a shinui . 1985 Not Serious • Miktzas choli (partially ill): A person is in great pain, but not to the point that he needs to rest in bed, and not to the point where his entire body is in pain. In this case, one may ask a non-Jew to do actions that are Rabbinically pro- hibited in order to treat him. 1986 • Meichush (minor ache): A person has a light ache. There are no leniencies for such a person. 1987",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1984. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  328:17.

330,19/06/2026,REFUAH: CHOLEH SHEEIN BO  SAKANAH;  SAKANAS EIVER,"We mentioned that when there is no danger, one may never transgress a Torah prohibition. Let us review the rules for the two more serious situations. If necessary, when a person’s whole body is in pain or he is ill to the point of needing bed rest, a non-Jew can perform an action that is a Torah melachah , and if that is not possible, a Jew can do so, but with a shinui . In a case where a limb is as risk (but not the person’s life), one can even transgress a Rabbinic prohibition without a shinui . Who Is Included in This More Serious Category • A person who is so ill that he genuinely needs to lie down____ • A person who has a higher than normal temperature and will not leave the house because of it. 1989 (Note that extremely high fever places one in the higher category of one whose life is in danger.) • A person who has an ache or pain that is causing his entire body to be weak, 1990 such as a migraine • A person who is fine now, but will need to lie down if he does not get medication, such as one who has asthma • A person who is in danger of losing a limb, such as someone who has a broken finger that can be attended to after Shabbos____ • A person who has an eye infection. (Note that extreme pain in the eye places one in the higher category of one whose life is in danger). 1992 • A child, up to the maximum age of nine____ • An elderly person who is weak. (One must consult a Rav before applying this leniency to an elderly person.) 1994 • A person who is suffering from being extremely cold____ The halachah for the all of the above, where it is necessary to alleviate the issue, is that a non-Jew can be asked to perform a Torah prohibition ( melachah ) for the Jewish patient, 1996 provided that it is a Shabbos need (and not for after Shabbos). Also, if there are no non-Jews available, a Jew (or the patient) can transgress any Rabbinic prohibition with a shinui (abnormally). 1997 Note that with regard to a limb that is in danger, a Jew may even transgress a Rabbinic prohibition without a shinui . 1998 Some Examples of Prohibited Acts • If a person suffers from any of the above, he may not drive a car or switch off an incandescent light bulb in order to help him sleep, because these constitute the Torah prohibition of maavir (lighting a fire). • He may not boil water to drink tea or soup, as this constitutes the Torah prohibition of bishul (cooking). • He may not tie a professional bandage, as this constitutes the Torah prohibition of kosher (tying). • He may not squeeze lemon juice into tea, as this constitutes the Torah prohibition of sechitah (squeezing), a form of dash (extracting). • He may not wet a towel with water to place on his forehead, as this would constitute the Torah prohibition of melaben (whitening). • He may not detach an herb from the ground, as this would constitute the Torah prohibition of kotzer (harvesting). • He may not extract a tooth, as this would constitute the Torah prohibi- tion of shochet (slaughtering). Examples of Acts That Are Permissible If Needed • One may ask a non-Jew to do any of the acts listed in the previous para- graph. However, he may not assist him in any way. This is especially relevant regarding acts that involve one’s body, such as extracting a tooth that is causing his entire body great pain. If a non-Jew is not available, a Jew can transgress a Rabbinic prohibition on his behalf with a shinui (abnormally) if it is necessary. For example, he can switch off an LED light (where there is no heat, just an electric current) using his elbow if it is necessary in order for him to rest.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1988.

331,20/06/2026,REFUAH: CHOLEH SHEEIN BO  SAKANAH;  SAKANAS EIVER  CONTINUED;  MEDICINE,"We are discussing the halachos regarding a person whose whole body is in pain or is ill to the point of requiring bed rest and a person who risks losing a limb, where it is not a danger to life. We have discussed that one may ask a non-Jew to perform a Torah prohi- bition on behalf of one who is ill but not in danger (as defined in Day___), as well as one who is in danger of losing a limb, and if necessary, a Jew can transgress a Rabbinic prohibition with a shinui (abnormally) on behalf of such a person. Muktzeh One may move an object that is muktzeh on behalf of such a person. If pos- sible, one should do so with a shinui (abnormally). 1999 Bishul Akum Chazal forbade eating food that was cooked by a non-Jew if it could not be eaten raw and is respectable enough to serve at a function. This prohibition exists even on a weekday. 2000 However, they were lenient regarding an ill person in this category, and so, he may eat food that was cooked for him by a non-Jew on Shabbos. 2001 The patient makes brachos on such food as normal. After Shabbos, that food becomes forbidden, as then a Jew can cook for him. 2002 NOTE: This is the one Rabbinic prohibition that was waived; all other Rabbinic prohibitions regarding food still apply. Because the food that was cooked by the non-Jew is forbidden after Shabbos, the pots and utensils with which the food was cooked should ideally be kashered, although some Poskim are lenient. Medicine Chazal were concerned that one may come to grind herbs in order to pro- duce medicine, 2003 which constitutes the melachah of tochen (grinding). They therefore forbade taking medicine on Shabbos. However, a person in the above categories is permitted to take medicine. 2004 One who is in the lighter categories (such as one who has a minor headache) may not take medicine. • One who has a pain that causes his entire body to ache may take med- icine. • One who has fever that restricts him to his house may take medicine. • One who is asthmatic or has a migraine may take medicine. One must be certain not to cut writing when removing capsules from the package, as this may constitute the melachah of mochek . If this is not possible, one should consult a Rav . One may break a pill into smaller pieces. It does not constitute mechatech (cutting). No Abnormal Way If a shinui is physically impossible, the Rabbinic prohibition may still be permitted. One should consult a Rav regarding how to proceed. 2005",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"1999. Kitzur Hilchos Shabbos  44:11;  Chayei Adam  69:16.

How- ever, a person who is ill but not in danger (as defined in Day___) or one who is in danger of losing a limb may take medication. We are discussing practical applications medicine. Hot-Water Bottles One may prepare a hot-water bottle for an extremely sore stomach (if one needs to lie down) or for one who is extremely cold. 2006 However, one should ensure that there is no cold water already in it that will get cooked when he fills it from an urn. Obviously, one may not boil up water for someone in this category, but one may ask a non-Jew to do so. If one is unsure if there is cold water inside the bottle, he should fill it up from a kli sheini (such as by pouring it from the urn to a jug, and then into the bottle). 2007 Asthma Pumps One may use an asthma pump. But one should check if opening the cylinder erases any writing on the powdered packets within and consult a Rav on how to proceed. Miktzas Choli and Meichush In general, most situations of illness are usually not as serious as these, and fall into the two lighter categories of miktzas choli (partially ill) and meichush (minor ache). Thus, medicine is generally prohibited on Shabbos. • One may not take medicine if he has a minor cold or sore throat. • One may not take medicine for a minor toothache or headache. • One may not use a nose spray or sinus rinse for a minor allergic reaction. • One may not take pain killers for minor pain. • One may not take vitamins to strengthen a weak system, but one may take them as his regular nutritional supplements. 2008 All this is in regard to taking medicine. For the further details of these cat- egories, see Day___. All forms of medicine are forbidden, until one falls into the category of choleh she’ein bo sakanah or sakanas eiver (as defined in Day___).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2006.

333,22/06/2026,REFUAH: PERMITTED MEDICATION - FOOD,"Food That Has Healing Properties One is permitted to eat food that possesses healing properties. The prohi- bition on medicine only applies to things that are not food. • One may eat chicken soup or drink tea or hot water with lemon and honey. (Note that making such drinks may involve bishul and sechitah . One must use a kli shelishi and pre-squeezed lemon juice or squeeze a piece of lemon directly onto the sugar, as opposed to into the liquid.) • One who has a sore throat can suck on a candy, but not a lozenge that is marketed as a cure for sore throats. • One who is hoarse may swallow a raw egg. 2009 • One who has heartburn may drink milk or eat a cucumber. • One who has a minor toothache can drink whiskey or brandy to ease the pain. 2010 Medicine Mixed into Food Medicine may be mixed into food before Shabbos (but not on Shabbos) and eaten inconspicuously, in a way that does not appear to any onlookers like medicine is being ingested. 2011 • One may put cough drops into a cup of juice before Shabbos, and drink it on Shabbos. This is because it is not the normal way to benefit from them, and it does not appear to the onlooker like taking medicine. 2012 • One may crush tablets and mix them into hummus or avocado dip be- fore Shabbos, and eat it on Shabbos. 2013 Medicine Taken for an Extended Period Medicine that must be taken for an extended period (preferably more than seven days____ ) is permitted. • If one was prescribed antibiotics or cortisone for a period of time during which Shabbos falls out, he may take the medicine on Shabbos, accord- ing to some Poskim . Obviously, if the doctor permits taking the medicine just before and just after Shabbos, that is the better option. • A person may take medicine for fertility treatment on Shabbos. • Contraceptive pills may be taken on Shabbos. 2015 However, preventing pregnancy has major Halachic ramifications, and is forbidden without the sanction of a Rav . Preventative Medicine One may take medication to prevent himself from entering the more serious category of choleh she’ein bo sakanah or sakanas eiver (as defined in Day___), in the same way that one already in that category may take medication on Shabbos. • If one who suffers from migraines sees spots or has a headache that is likely to develop into a migraine, he may take medication to prevent it. 2016",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2009.

334,23/06/2026,"REFUAH: PERMITTED MEDICATION,  CONTINUED","We have seen that one may not take medicine unless he is in the category of choleh she’ein bo sakanah . We discussed four leniencies so far: 1. Regular food that happens to also work as a medicine may be eaten. 2. One may mix medicine into food before Shabbos, and inconspicu- ously eat it on Shabbos. 2017_. Medicine that is prescribed for an extended period (preferably more than seven days____ ) may be taken. 4. Medication that prevents one from entering a state in which medica- tion would be permitted may also be taken. We will now discuss a few more leniencies. External Issues One may remove issues that are not internal if no cure is involved. • One may remove a splinter or pop a blister or pimple that is sore, but he should try to avoid drawing out blood. 2019 One certainly must not apply pressure that will extract blood. One must also not detach any pieces of skin from the area. 2020 • One may remove a bee or wasp stinger from his skin. • One may take sleeping pills if he suffers greatly from insomnia. 2021 Not Medicinal Methods that are never medicinal and will never require medication are generally permitted. 2022 • One may place an ice cube on a bruise to treat swelling, as it will never require additional medication. 2023 • One may wear a dental or back brace, as no medication is needed for the treatment. Physiotherapy is forbidden on Shabbos, as it may also involve medication. (It may also cause one to sweat for healing purposes. See below.) 2024 A basic mas- sage for pleasure or to strengthen one’s muscles is permitted, 2025 but a vigorous massage is prohibited. Professional chiropractic treatments are forbidden unless one is a choleh she’ein bo sakanah . Sweating as a Form of Medicine Any treatment that induces sweating is forbidden. Moreover, any activity that induces sweating may be forbidden under a Rabbinic prohibition known as uvdin d’chol (weekday activities). See Day__. • One may not jog or exercise on Shabbos. However, one may go for a walk____ or stretch (even for health reasons) as it is not obvious that health is his purpose. 2027 Saunas and Steam Baths One may not go into a sauna or steam bath____ even if it has been turned on with a timer or by a non-Jew. Spiritual Medication Spiritual medications are permitted. • There are spiritual ways to remove an ayin hara (evil eye) from a person. Doing so is permitted on Shabbos. 2029 • The Gemara states that drinking from the wine on which Kiddush was recited Friday night causes one to regain his eyesight. Although it could be viewed as a cure, it is permitted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2017. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  328:21.

335,24/06/2026,REFUAH: MIKTZAS CHOLI;  MEICHUSH,"We have discussed a person who is in danger, a person who is very sore or needs bed rest but is not in danger, and a person who is in danger of losing a limb. We also discussed the major applications of the halachos of taking med- icine on Shabbos. The final two categories are those in which the pain or illness is much lighter than the cases above. Miktzas Choli This category is where a person is in pain, but not to the point that he must rest in bed, and not to the point that his entire body is sore. A Jew may not transgress Shabbos for such a person. However, one may ask a non-Jew to perform an act that is Rabbinically prohibited in order to treat him. 2030 Meichush A person in this category merely has a light ache. One may not transgress Shabbos to help such a person, even through a non-Jew. 2031 A person who is in one of the two above categories may not take medication. However, the leniencies regarding medication that we discussed above still apply to such a person. • One who has a sore throat, mild headache, or toothache may not take pills or gargle. 2032 Only once the pain reaches the point where his entire body feels sore, or he needs bed rest, may he take medication. However, he may take medication to prevent his illness from developing into such a situation. He may also eat regular food if it helps, or mix medication into food before Shabbos and eat it on Shabbos. 2033 He may remove anything external that is causing the pain, and use any method that does not involve medication. Treating an Alcoholic One may not give medication or sugar infusions to an alcoholic to alleviate his difficulties, 2034 nor may the alcoholic take vomit-inducing drugs. 2035 However, one may give him water or black coffee. Obviously, if his life is in danger, one may give him whatever he requires, even transgressing Shabbos if necessary. Gym Balls One may sit or do light exercise on a gym ball to relax his muscles or assist with muscle treatment. One may blow up such a ball, even with a manual pump, provided that it is not the first time that it is being inflated. 2036 Snuff One may smell snuff on Shabbos. 2037 Wheelchairs See Day___ for a discussion on wheelchairs regarding hotzaah (carrying), and a few more halachos of a wheelchair regarding choresh (plowing) and kotzer (harvesting) in Day___.

336,25/06/2026,REFUAH: OPEN WOUNDS,"Until now, we have discussed the different categories of sick people, and what leniencies there are for treating them. Any wound also fits into one of the three main categories. • One who has a life-threatening cut may transgress Shabbos in order to treat it, if necessary. 2038 • A Jewish doctor can stitch up the life-threatening wound of any Jew- ish patient, if leaving it until after Shabbos is not an option. Similarly, he may tie a permanent bandage to avoid loss of blood if not doing so presents a danger to the patient’s life (Sewing and tying would usually constitute Torah prohibitions). • A person who has a cut that is very painful but not life-threatening may not transgress Shabbos in order to treat it. However, if his entire body is sore or he needs bed rest, he may ask a non-Jew to treat it (even if it involves a melachah ), and if this is not feasible, a Jew may transgress a Rabbinic prohibition with a shinui (abnormally) on his behalf. 2039 • Smearing a thick ointment on one’s body constitutes a Torah prohi- bition. However, if one has a wound that is causing pain to his entire body or causes him to need bed rest, he may ask a non-Jew to smear ointment onto the wound or a bandage. 2040 • If a person has a minor cut that is just a bother, he may not put any medicine on it or treat it. 2041 However, he may wipe it gently with water to clean it. If there is concern of an infection, 2042 he may apply antiseptic liquid normally, or cream by dabbing it on (even if the bandage smears it, it is permitted). One may not suck out the blood, pinch, or dab at a wound, as deliberately extracting blood constitutes a Torah prohibition, and is only permitted in life-threatening situations. • One may not put anything on a paper cut. However, he may rinse and clean it. • One may pour antiseptic liquid on a cut from an old piece of glass. • One who has a bloody nose may squeeze the top of the nose to cause clotting. This is not considered extracting blood. One may also stick cotton into his nose. 2043 Cleaning a Wound If one has a bleeding wound, he should first rinse it under water so that it is clear, before wiping it with material. If that is not possible, one can wipe it with material that is not red. If that is not possible, one may even use a red material. One may always wipe it with a tissue that will certainly be discarded after use, or bandages.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2038. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  329:1—4.

337,26/06/2026,REFUAH: DRY SKIN;  BURNS;   BLEEDING;  SQUEEZING,"Treating Dry Skin Rubbing thick creams, Vaseline, and lipstick constitute prohibitions. Regarding rubbing oil, one may use it to prevent dry skin from cracking open and bleeding. 2044 However, one may generally not use oil on skin that already has cracks and is sore, as medicine may not be used on Shabbos. Still, one may even use oil on cracked skin if people in that place normally rub their hands with oil, even when they are healthy. Treating Burns • If a burn is or could be life-threatening (such as a third-degree burn), one must do whatever is necessary to save the person. • If the burn is so painful that one’s entire body is sore or he needs bed rest (but it is not life-threatening, such as a second-degree burn), one may ask a non-Jew to do a melachah , such as rub cream on or call a doctor. If this is not practical, a Jew may transgress any Rabbinic prohibitions with a shinui (abnormally), and the patient may take medication. • If it is a minor burn (such as first-degree), one may not transgress any prohibitions. However, he may put it under running water. 2045 Note that a burn that is likely to erupt into an infection or covers a large area of skin may be life-threatening. A doctor should be consulted. Avoiding Shochet When cleaning or bandaging a wound, one must be certain not to deliber- ately extract any blood (the melachah of shochet [slaughtering]). • One may only scratch a mosquito bite or remove puss from an inflamed fingernail if he is careful not to deliberately cause any bleeding. Avoiding Sechitah When cleaning or bandaging a wound, one must be certain not to squeeze liquid from the material (which is prohibited under the melachah of dash [ex- tracting]). • One may pour water on a cut and wipe it very gently with precut gauze, being sure not to squeeze any liquid from it. • One may not use a baby wipe or wet towel to wipe a wound unless he is certain that it will not squeeze out liquid.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2044.

338,27/06/2026,REFUAH: INJECTIONS;  DIABETICS,"Injections There are two issues with injections: the Torah prohibition of extracting blood ( shochet ), and the Rabbinic prohibition to take medication. For this rea- son, an injection directly into a muscle or below the skin poses less of an issue than one that is intravenous, because it may avoid extracting blood. 2046 • If is the situation is life-threatening, one must give the patient whatever he needs, even transgressing Shabbos if necessary. • If one is ill but not in danger and his entire body is sore or he needs bed rest, one can give the patient an injection into a muscle or directly below the skin, in a place where blood is not always drawn. If the patient requires an intravenous injection (into a vein), it may only be done by a non-Jew. 2047 • If one is only suffering from a mild issue, one may not give him injec- tions. If the doctor recommends administering a prophylactic to a healthy person who is deteriorating to prevent his life from being endangered, one may do so. 2048 When giving injections is permitted, one should pour disinfectant directly on the area first, and then wipe with a tissue or synthetic material. Such material should be precut. If it was not precut, one should ask a non-Jew to cut it, or do so with a shinui (abnormally), but not on perforated lines (which would involve the melachah of mechatech ). When opening a package of a sterile syringe, one should be sure not to tear any letters. One may also open a new bottle of medicine even though creating new vessels is usually prohibited. One should also avoid tearing on the writing; where this is not possible, one should consult a Rav . Although administering intravenous injections is forbidden unless there is a danger to life, one may remove an empty packet of intravenous fluid and replace it with a new one. A Jewish doctor should be careful not to write or travel unnecessarily, de- pending on the three categories that we discussed. Diabetics A diabetic who needs injections every day (such as when eating) may take them. 2049 If not checking blood sugar levels presents a danger, one may use a glucom- eter. However, one should preferably get a non-Jew to turn on such a device, or turn it on with a shinui (abnormally). 2050",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2046.

339,28/06/2026,MUKTZEH (ITEMS THAT ARE  DESIGNATED FOR NON-USE),"Introduction There is a Rabbinic prohibition to handle items that are muktzeh on Shab- bos. “ Muktzeh ” literally means “set aside,” referring to objects that are set apart from use on Shabbos. We will see that there are different types of muktzeh . In some cases, moving the item is always prohibited, and in other cases, it may be permitted in certain circumstances. The Reason for Muktzeh There are different opinions regarding why Chazal enacted the halachos of muktzeh . • The Raavad, based on the Gemara, writes that the prohibition was en- acted to prevent people from carrying or transferring the item in for- bidden areas (the Torah prohibition of hotzaah ). 2051 • The Rambam writes that it is to ensure that Shabbos remains a day of rest. 2052 Just as we are to walk, speak, and dress differently on Shab- bos from the rest of the week, we should only use objects that are not weekday objects. In addition, the halachos of muktzeh were enacted to prevent us from doing forbidden melachos , which is likely to follow when handling weekday objects. The Severity of Muktzeh There is a discussion among the commentators whether the prohibition of muktzeh is more severe than other Rabbinic prohibitions, 2053 or weaker. 2054 The ramifications involve when to apply the prohibition in extenuating circumstanc- es, but either way, one must be very careful with it. Shabbos and Yom Tov Muktzeh applies on Yom Tov as well as Shabbos. Indeed, in some cases, it is even stricter on Yom Tov. When Uncertain Whether Something Is Muktzeh In most cases, if one is unsure whether something was usable already before Shabbos, he must treat it as muktzeh . 2055 • Fish that was not already caught before Yom Tov still requires the melachah of tzad (trapping), and so, any fish that was somehow caught on Yom Tov (even automatically) is forbidden until the end of Yom Tov. If one is unsure if the fish was caught before Yom Tov, he must treat it as if it was caught on Yom Tov, and it is muktzeh . • Fruits that were not detached from their source before Shabbos still require the melachah of kotzer (harvesting), and so, fruits that fell on Shabbos are forbidden until after Shabbos. If one is unsure if the fruits fell before Shabbos, he must treat them as if they fell on Shabbos, and they are muktzeh. 2056 We will discuss the different types of muktzeh along with relevant examples.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2051.

340,29/06/2026,MUKTZEH: KLI SHEMELACHTO L’ISSUR,"We will now begin to discuss the different categories of muktzeh (the pro- hibition to move items that are not designated for use on Shabbos). The first category is known as kli shemelachto l’issur — an object whose principle usage is for something that is prohibited (whether by the Torah or Rabbinically____ ) on Shabbos. Before elaborating on the halachos that apply to a kli shemelachto l’issur , we will discuss what objects fall into this category. Principal Use • A pen: the principle use is writing, which constitutes the Torah prohi- bition of kosev . • A guitar: 2058 the principal use is for music, which constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. 2059 Multiple Uses An item is defined by what it is principally used for. Meaning, an item that is sometimes used for a permitted act but whose main use is for a prohibited act is muktzeh under this category. 2060 • A needle is mostly used for sewing, which constitutes the Torah pro- hibition of tofer . This renders it muktzeh , even though it is sometimes used for taking out a splinter, which is permitted (provided that one will not draw blood____ ). • A cheap cell phone (and only if it is not valuable) is mostly used for talking or texting, which is at least forbidden under the Rabbinic pro- hibition of creating an electric current (see Day___). This renders it muktzeh even though it is sometimes used simply to tell the time, a task that is fulfilled without the need to operate it. The Halachah Even though one may generally not move a kli shemelachto l’issur , two le- niencies apply: 1. One may use it for a permitted act, if there is no non- muktzeh item readily available. 2062_. One may move it if he needs the space that it is occupying. 2063 • One may not move a hammer on Shabbos. However, if he needs it to crack open a coconut, he may do so if there is no non- muktzeh item that can efficiently open the coconut. Furthermore, if the hammer is in a place where one wishes to sit, he may move it. We will soon discuss further details about the category of kli shemelachto l’issur .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2057. Biur Halachah  308:3, “ Kli SheMelachto L’Issur .”

341,30/06/2026,"MUKTZEH: KLI SHEMELACHTO  L’ISSUR, CONTINUED","We have seen that a kli shemelachto l’issur is an object that is primarily used for an act that is prohibited on Shabbos. One may generally not move it, but one may use it for a permitted act (if there is no other viable option), and one may move it if he needs the space that it is occupying. There are more types of objects that fall into this category. An Object That Serves Muktzeh Items Any object that is used for the purpose of an object that may not be used on Shabbos also falls into this muktzeh category. • Money is muktzeh , as transactions are prohibited on Shabbos. 2064 A wallet does not in and of itself perform any actual prohibition. Howev- er, because it is used to store money, which is muktzeh , it is considered a kli shemelachto l’issur . Therefore, a wallet, 2065 even if it is currently empty, may not be moved unless one needs it for a permitted use, or one needs the space that it occupies. 2066 Note that if it has money in, it falls under another category of muktzeh , known as bassis (see Days___—332). Objects That Are Rabbinically Forbidden An object that is Rabbinically forbidden for use for any reason, such as be- cause using it looks like one is transgressing Shabbos ( maris ayin ), or because using it cheapens or degrades Shabbos, falls under the category of kli shemelachto l’issur. 2067 • Hanging up clothes on a clothesline is not an actual melachah . Chazal prohibited it because people may think that one did laundry on Shabbos (which constitutes the melachah of melaben ). 2068 Nonetheless, a laundry peg is considered a kli shemelachto l’issur , and is muktzeh . • Tefillin are not worn on Shabbos because they are called a “sign” of the covenant between Hashem and the Jewish nation, and Shabbos is a sufficient sign in its own right. Were one to wear tefillin on Shabbos, it would detract from the meaning of Shabbos. 2069 Although wearing tefillin does not constitute a melachah , tefillin are included in the cate- gory of kli shemelachto l’issur , as they are not worn on Shabbos. Tefillin are therefore muktzeh. 2070 It should be noted that tefillin may be moved if they are in danger of being damaged or have fallen on the floor. 2071 Furthermore, if one mistakenly left his tefillin bag in the same bag as his tallis, although it is best to remove the tallis from the bag without moving the tefillin, one may remove the tefillin to get to the tallis if necessary. 2072",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2064.

342,01/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: KLI SHEMELACHTO  L’ISSUR, CONTINUED","We are currently defining objects that fall into the category of kli shemelachto l’issur . One may not move objects in this category, except in order to use them in a permitted manner (if there is nothing else available) or if one needs the space that they are occupying. Electric Appliances Electric appliances are generally forbidden for use on Shabbos because their whole use is for a melachah , and because they need to be turned on before use. They therefore fall under the category of kli shemelachto l’issur , and are muk- tzeh. 2073 They may only be moved under the conditions enumerated above. • A fan is a kli shemelachto l’issur since it requires being turned on before use, and may therefore not be indiscriminately moved on Shabbos. However, one may move a fan (that was on before Shabbos or set on a timer) so that it blows in a different direction. (Similarly, one may adjust the vents of an air conditioner.) Furthermore, one may move the fan to a different location if he wishes to use it elsewhere. In all cases of mov- ing it, one should be careful that it does not get unplugged. Obviously, one may not adjust the speed of the fan, as it will cause a change in the electric current. • A cheap cell phone is a kli shemelachto l‘issur , as it can perform several prohibited acts. Therefore, it may not be moved on Shabbos. However, if ringing or an alarm from the cell phone is causing a disturbance, one may move it to a place where the noise will be muffled. 2074 (Note that a phone that automatically turns on when moved may obviously not be moved at all on Shabbos.) On the Subject of Gadgets It is worth mentioning at this stage that if a gadget is expensive, or the owner values it greatly (even in a non-monetary sense), it falls under a stricter muktzeh category known as c hisaron kis . A muktzeh item in this category may not be moved even for a permitted usage, and not even for the space that it is occupying. We will discuss this category at a later stage. • A valuable smartphone or camera falls under the category of chisa- ron kis , and may not be moved on Shabbos. However, a cheap one is not considered valuable, and the leniencies of a kli shemelachto l’issur apply.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2073. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  13:40. Note that some  Poskim  are stringent regarding items  that have no permitted use at all on Shabbos. See  Orchos Shabbos  19:6.

343,02/07/2026,MUKTZEH: KLI SHEMELACHTO L’ISSUR:  AN ITEM THAT IS NOT A “KLI”,"Introduction We have defined a kli shemelachto l’issur as an object that is primarily used for an act that is forbidden on Shabbos. One may not move an object in this category indiscriminately. However, one may move it in order to use it for a permitted purpose (if there is no alternative), or if one needs the space that it occupies. As we are discussing which items fall into this muktzeh category, we will discuss a different category that is related, before returning to the subject of kli shemelachto l’issur . Not a “Vessel” In order to qualify for the category of kli shemelachto l’issur , the object must be considered a “ kli ” (vessel or container). 2075 The two leniencies that we discussed above do not apply to anything that is not a kli , and one may not move it at all. 2076 This is because its usage is limited — it cannot be used for storage or to perform any other function in its own right. This category of muktzeh , items that are inherently useless, is known as muktzeh machmas gufo (literally, muktzeh because of itself). We will discuss this category extensively in Days___—323. • A piece of firewood is used primarily for burning, which is a prohibited act on Shabbos. Because it is not a “vessel,” it is considered muktzeh machmas gufo . Therefore, one may not move it at all on Shabbos. • Detergent is used for washing clothes, which is a prohibited act. Because it is not a “vessel,” it is considered muktzeh machmas gufo . Therefore, one may not move it at all on Shabbos. This contrasts with a kli shemelachto l’issur , which has a use in its own right, but whose principal use is for an act that is forbidden on Shabbos. • A frying pan is used primarily for cooking, which is a prohibited act. However, it is a “vessel” in its own right, and is able to hold and store things. Therefore, it still falls under the category of kli shemelachto l’issur , and the two leniencies discussed above apply to it. 2077 • Matches are used for lighting a fire, which is a prohibited act on Shab- bos. However, because an unused match can, for instance, be used as a toothpick, it is a kli shemelachto l’issur , possessing the two leniencies discussed above. This is different from a used match, which is unlikely to ever be used as a toothpick, and therefore is muktzeh machmas gufo. 2078 Designated for Use If one designated any muktzeh item for use from before Shabbos, it will not be considered muktzeh . This applies even to the stringent category of muktzeh machmas gufo . • A stone is not a vessel, 2079 and is therefore considered muktzeh machmas gufo . However, if one designates a particular stone to use as a doorstop or napkin holder, that stone will not be muktzeh on Shabbos, and may be moved. 2080 In summary, only an item that is useful in its own right can be considered a kli shemelachto l’issur , not an item that has no intrinsic use. As mentioned, we will discuss the category of muktzeh machmas gufo and designating such items for use on Shabbos in more detail at a later point.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2075.

344,03/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: KLI SHEMELACHTO  L’ISSUR, CONTINUED","We have defined a kli shemelachto l’issur as an object that is primarily used for an act that is forbidden on Shabbos. One may not move an object in this category indiscriminately. One of the leniencies of moving a kli shemelachto l’issur is that one may use it for a permitted purpose (if there is no alternative). We will now elaborate on this. No Alternative Although one may move a kli shemelachto l’issur in order to use it for a permit- ted act, he may only use a kli shemelachto l’issur if there is no alternate non- muk- tzeh item to use instead. 2081 However, one need not apply considerable effort in order to find a non- muktzeh alternative. 2082 • One should only use a hammer to crack nuts if he does not have a nut- cracker available. However, one need not borrow a nutcracker from a neighbor so as to avoid using a hammer; in this case, he may use a hammer. Later Use Even if one does not need a kli shemelachto l’issur immediately, but will likely need it soon, he may move it, but he may not move it in order to use it after Shabbos. 2083 • If one is expecting visitors, he may take a hammer and start cracking nuts, even though there is currently no need for them. As a Toy Using a kli shemelachto l’issur to play with children is also considered a per- mitted use, assuming that there is nothing else available. 2084 If the item is des- ignated as a toy from before Shabbos, one may use it as he wishes, obviously without doing any prohibited act — it need not be a last resort (as we learned in Day___). • If there are no other toys available to amuse children, one may use a hammer to entertain them (though this is probably not advisable for fear of what they may do with a hammer when there are no adults present.) For a Jew One may move a kli shemelachto l’issur for a permitted use by any Jew. How- ever, one may not move it for the benefit of a non-Jew. 2085 • One may hand a hammer to any Jew who needs it to crack nuts. How- ever, one may not move a hammer for a non-Jew to use. For an Animal One may move a kli shemelachto l’issur for the benefit of an animal. 2086 • One may use a hammer to crack nuts for a pet that is dependent on its owner for food. (Feeding animals that are not dependent on their owners is forbidden on Shabbos [see Day___].) NOTE: Whenever it is permitted to move a kli shemelachto l’issur , one can move it to wherever he desires, even to protect it from harm. 2087",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2081.

We will now discuss the second leniency — the permissibility of moving it in order to use the space that it is occupying. The Leniency One may move an item in the category of kli shemelachto l’issur if he needs the area that it is occupying. Once one has picked it up, he may move it to wherever he wishes. 2088 • If an empty pot fell, blocking the hallway that people use, one may move it. • If the door of a washing machine is preventing access to an area that one needs, he may close it (unless it will cause an electrical reaction). 2089 • If a hammer is on the table and one wishes to put a new tablecloth on, he may remove it. 2090 A Disturbance Even if one does not need the space, but the object is causing a disturbance or is an eyesore, one may move it. • If one uses a cheap cell phone as an alarm clock, he may remove it from the room when the alarm rings. 2091 (Note that a phone that automatically turns on when moved may obviously not be moved at all on Shabbos.) • According to some Poskim , if one is expecting visitors and will be un- comfortable that there are pens and crayons on the floor, he may move them. Even if one will not necessarily need the space that they are oc- cupying, he may move them in order to have a neat house. 2092 Inappropriate for Shabbos If one only wishes to move items in this category because they are not ap- propriate to have out on Shabbos, he may not move them. 2093 • If one has left a shaver or cheap cell phone lying around, one may not move it simply because it is disrespectful to have out on Shabbos. One may only move it if there is a genuine reason to use that particular space. (Note that a smartphone or something valuable may not be moved regardless.) A Halachic Issue One may move an item that is a kli shemelachto l’issur if it is causing a Hala- chic issue. • There are many rules regarding preserving the sanctity of holy items, such as tefillin and sefarim . In many cases, it is forbidden to expose such items to parts of the body that are Halachically considered naked areas; one must cover these items or remove them. 2094 Based on this, one may not change a diaper in a room where there are uncovered tefillin. If one needs to change a diaper in a room where tefillin are uncovered, one may move them even though they are in the category of kli shemelachto l’issur . 2095 NOTE: When it is permitted to move a kli shemelachto l’issur , one can move it to wherever he desires, even to protect it from harm. 2096",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2088.

However, according to most Poskim , there is a different leniency that is applicable to all forms of muktzeh — moving the muktzeh item in an abnormal way, known as a shinui . 2097 This is permitted even to protect the muktzeh item itself. 2098 • One may hold his wallet in his mouth and move it to another place for safekeeping. • One may nudge a passport to a different place with his elbow or foot. 2099 • If one finds money on the floor, he may kick it to a place where it will be hidden from sight until after Shabbos. 2100 A Real Change The shinui must be a genuine change from the normal way of moving the item. • One may not move stones with his feet if that is how they are usually moved. Blowing One may move anything by blowing it. 2101 • One may blow ash or dust off of a surface, even if he does not need the space. To review: The leniency of moving muktzeh in an unusual manner applies to all categories of muktzeh . However, the leniencies of moving the item for a permitted use or to use the space that it occupies are only applicable to the category of kli shemelachto l’issur .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2097.

347,06/07/2026,MUKTZEH: PICKED UP BY MISTAKE;  SAVING FROM LOSS,"We have discussed two leniencies regarding moving a kli shemelachto l’issur , and one more leniency that is applicable to all categories of muktzeh : • One may move a kli shemelachto l’issur in order to use it for something that is permitted on Shabbos. • One may move a kli shemelachto l’issur because he needs the space that it is occupying. • One may move any type of muktzeh item with a shinui (abnormally). Picked Up by Mistake If one mistakenly picked up a kli shemelachto l’issur , transgressing the prohi- bition of muktzeh , he need not immediately drop the item. Rather, he may carry it to wherever is convenient and put it down. Obviously, this must be a genuine mistake. This leniency only applies to kli shemelachto l’issur , but not to other categories of muktzeh , which one must put down immediately. 2102 • If one has mistakenly picked up a set of barbecue tongs, which obviously has no use on Shabbos, he may take it to the proper place, even though he has just transgressed the prohibition of muktzeh . • If one mistakenly picked up a stone that was not designated for use on Shabbos, he must immediately put it down. Saving from Loss One may not move a muktzeh item in the regular way to prevent it from being stolen or destroyed. 2103 In such a situation, one has the following options: 1. He can ask a non-Jew to move the item. 2104_. He can move it using a shinui . 3. In the case of a kli shemelachto l’issur, one can move it in compliance with one of the regular leniencies enumerated above (for a permitted use or for the space it occupies), even if his primary intention is to save it. • If an expensive cell phone is outside in the rain and likely to get damaged, one may not move it. However, he may ask a non-Jew to move it. Another option is to move it abnormally, such as with his mouth. If it is a cheap cell phone that is not valuable to the owner, he can move it in order to use for a permissible use such as to use as a paperweight, even though his primary intention is to save it. He can also move it in order to use the space that it was occupying to place his cup of coffee, even though his primary intention is to save it. (The item must be in a place where carrying is not prohibited, such as in a karmelis with an eiruv .)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2102.

348,07/07/2026,MUKTZEH: CHISARON KIS,"We will now discuss the category of muktzeh known as chisaron kis (literally “a loss of the pocket”). Anything that is valuable to its owner, regardless of mon- etary value, falls into this category. It is stricter than kli shemelachto l’issur , as it does not possess the leniencies of using it for a permitted purpose or moving it for the space that it is occupying. DEFINING CHISARON KIS If an item is forbidden to use on Shabbos and is valuable to the owner, such that he is concerned about it ever being lost or misused, 2105 or he is particular not to use it for anything other than its intended purpose, 2106 it is included in this category. Concern over the item is dependent on the values of the individual owner, not on the way that it is generally treated. 2107 It need not be expensive, but if it is expensive, it is almost certainly included in this category, and may not be moved. 2108 Examples of Chisaron Kis • A knife used for bris milah or for shechitah . A mohel or shochet is always careful not to lose or damage his special knife. However, a mohel can use his bris milah knife to perform a circumcision on Shabbos if that is the eighth day. A Rav should be consulted to deal with the complications involved with a “Shabbos bris.” • An expensive smartphone, laptop, or camera. These are expensive or store vital information. Therefore, the owner is careful not to lose or damage it. 2109 • An esrog (that one intends to use for the upcoming festival of Sukkos). One is always careful not to lose or damage his esrog before Sukkos has begun. This is true even if it was purchased at a cheap price, and certainly if it was expensive. Therefore, on Shabbos it is muktzeh . On Sukkos, it is designated for use, and may therefore be moved. We will discuss moving an esrog in order to smell it in Day___. • A credit card. One would certainly be worried if it is misused. • Official identification papers. Reapplying to get new ones is difficult, and they are necessary for their function or for travel. One therefore regards them as valuable.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2104. Mishnah Berurah  308:15.

Goods Slated to Be Returned Similarly, if a person plans to return goods to a store after Shabbos, the items are muktzeh and may not be moved. This is because the person is particular not use or damage such items. 2114 • If one purchased clothes that are the wrong size, he will be careful not to lose or damage them, in order to return them after Shabbos.

Valuable and Permitted What is the halachah regarding objects that have a permitted use on Shabbos, yet they are valuable, to the point that the owner would not want them to be damaged, lost, or misused? The halachah is that one may move such an item if he generally would not mind using it for that purpose. 2115 • One may move or use an expensive wine decanter that he only brings out on special occasions, even though it is very valuable to its owner. However, if the decanter is only on the shelf as part of the fancy décor of the house, and he never uses it, he may not move it on Shabbos. • People generally do not use Pesach cutlery and tableware during the year because doing so would preclude the possibility of using it on Pesach. Although there is debate about this among the Poskim , one may be le- nient, because their use is permitted on Shabbos. If one needs to move or use a vessel from the Pesach set, he may do so. However, Pesach sets that are heirlooms, and that would be unthinkable to use otherwise, may not be moved or used. 2116",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2115.

Designated Storage Place An item that must always be stored in a designated place so that it will not be damaged, lost, or misused also falls under this category. 2117 The fact that the owner is particular to store it there indicates that it is of value to him. However, there is a dispute among the Poskim regarding items that the owner stores in a designated place for no particular reason, and he does not mind if they get moved or misused. 2118 One should be stringent and treat such items as muktzeh , if possible. • Although a painting is obviously placed on the wall for décor, the owner also hangs it there so that it will not get lost or damaged. Therefore, it is muktzeh , and may not be moved even if it falls down. One may not tilt it if it becomes uneven. • On the other hand, most wall clocks are cheap, and are only placed on the wall so that everyone should to be able to see the time easily. In such a case, there is a dispute whether one may move it. If possible, one should be stringent. A grandfather clock that one received as an heirloom certainly may not be moved, as it has sentimental value. • Large appliances, such as refrigerators and washing machines, are placed in specific places so that they are not moved or damaged. If something falls under or behind such an appliance, one may not move it to get to the item. The door of such an appliance is a kli shemelachto l’issur , and may only be moved for a permitted purpose or if it is in the way. 2119 • If one is careful not to move a cabinet for fear that it may get damaged, it is muktzeh due to chisaron kis and may not be moved. On the oth- er hand, a couch or bed that one regularly moves or is not concerned about, may be moved. 2120",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2117. Mishnah Berurah  308:8.

One may designate such an item before Shabbos to be used on Shabbos. This does not require any act — as long as one made a conscious decision before Shabbos that the item will be used on Shabbos, it is sufficient. 2121 • Although the wine decanter on the shelf is only there for décor and one does not want it to get damaged, lost, or misused, one may use it on Shabbos if he decided before Shabbos to bring it out for some special occasion. • Assuming that a jeweler never uses his products before selling them, thus rendering them muktzeh , he may move a piece of jewelry on Shab- bos if he decided before Shabbos to use it on Shabbos. 2122 NOTE: The rules regarding designating items that have no use ( muktzeh mach- mas gufo ) are different and will be discussed in Day___. Broken Items If an item that falls under the category of chisaron kis breaks on Shabbos, the broken pieces continue to be muktzeh , and may not be moved.

In Day___, we touched upon a third category: muktzeh mach- mas gufo . We will now discuss it in more detail. Because of Itself Machmas gufo literally translates as “because of itself.” That is, it is muktzeh because it has absolutely no genuine use. 2125 This includes anything that is not a usable vessel (as we discussed in Day___). 2126 • Stones have no genuine use. They are therefore muktzeh . • Eggshells have no genuine use. They are therefore muktzeh , and may not be moved unless they are part of a separate leniency called graf shel re’i , which we will learn about (in Day___). 2127 • Raw potatoes and uncooked rice have no genuine use since they are not edible for humans or animals, and they may not be cooked on Shabbos. They are therefore muktzeh . 2128 On Yom Tov, when cooking is permitted, they are not muktzeh . 2129 The Halachah This category carries the same strictness as chisaron kis (items that are valu- able to their owner). They may not be moved at all except in an abnormal way, and the two leniencies of a kli shemelachto l’issur do not apply to them. • One may not use a stone as a doorstop, as a stone is muktzeh machmas gufo . Although use as a doorstop should be a permitted use, it may not be moved because a stone is not considered a real vessel with an inherent use. 2130 Furthermore, one may not move a stone that is in the way. (Even doing so with one’s foot is forbidden, as that is a normal way of moving stones, and does not constitute a shinui . One would have to find a truly abnormal way to remove the stone.)

Obviously, such an item may never be moved on Shabbos. • One may not move a lit candle on Shabbos, as doing so will cause multi- ple transgressions of maavir (lighting a fire) and mechabeh (extinguish- ing a fire). 2140 • One may not move a smartphone with a screen that automatically lights up when it is moved. • One may not move a compass with a digital display, as moving it causes the needle on the display to move.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2131.

355,14/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MACHMAS GUFO,  CONTINUED","We are discussing the muktzeh category of machmas gufo , which includes anything that is not a vessel and does not have a permissible Shabbos use. We will now see that things that were not permitted before Shabbos also fall into this category. Did Not Exist Before Shabbos Anything that did not exist before Shabbos began, and only came into being on Shabbos (known as nolad [born]) is muktzeh . Because it did not exist before Shabbos, it does not have a usable status. In this case, even if there is a doubt whether it existed before Shabbos or not, the halachah is that it is muktzeh . 2141 Was Muktzeh Before Shabbos If an object was muktzeh before Shabbos because it was not accessible or because a melachah is required to get to it, it remains muktzeh . This is true even if it is now accessible — once it was inaccessible before Shabbos, it remains muktzeh until after Shabbos ends. Examples of Nolad • An egg that was or may have been laid on Shabbos____ • Fruits or leaves that fell or may have fallen from a tree on Shabbos____ • Juice that came out of the kind of fruit that one is forbidden to squeeze on Shabbos (see Day___ for more details) 2144 • Anything that broke on Shabbos, and the broken parts are not usable____ (However, if they are dangerous, they may be moved.) • Milk that was or may have been milked from a cow (even without hu- man intervention) on Shabbos____ • Oil or wax that was or may have melted from Shabbos candles____ NOTE: Rain and snow are not muktzeh . 2148 Empty Disposable Containers According to some Poskim , empty milk bags or bottles, as well as any dispos- able container that became empty on Shabbos, are muktzeh as soon as they are no longer useful. 2149 However, we will see that items that are unpleasant to the eye, such as dirt, dead animals, and garbage, have a special leniency, and their removal may be permitted. 2150 Therefore, if the empty containers are very disturbing to have around, removing them may be permitted (see Day___ for more details).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2141.

356,15/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MACHMAS GUFO,  CONTINUED - FOOD","Food Raw food is muktzeh if it cannot be eaten without cooking, which is pro- hibited on Shabbos. Therefore, one may not move aside raw meat or chicken to reach the ice cream in a freezer. 2155 On the other hand, cooked food is not muktzeh , even if it is frozen. There- fore, one may move aside frozen cooked chicken to reach the ice cream in a freezer. Raw eggs are sometimes used by people to clear their voices, and are not muktzeh. 2156 Note that removing things from a freezer may involve borer (see also Day 105). Animals Animals are muktzeh and may not be moved. Even pets that are raised for the enjoyment of their owners are not considered to have a real use, and are muktzeh. 2157 One may not even move their cages. Fish tanks are also muktzeh , but one may remove the cover in order to feed the fish. 2158 When an animal is in distress, one may not transgress a Torah prohibition in order to help it. However, according to some Poskim , if it is in distress one may move it (a Rabbinic prohibition) for its benefit (see Day___). 2159 Aluminum Foil, Plastic Wrap, String, and Toilet Paper Aluminum foil, plastic wrap, and rolls of string are not usable until they have been cut, which one is forbidden to do on Shabbos. They are therefore muktzeh . Similarly, cutting or tearing toilet paper is forbidden on Shabbos. There is, however, a leniency specific to toilet paper, since it may be necessary to maintain human dignity. If a person is in a situation where he cannot access tissues or precut toilet paper, he may tear toilet paper with a shinui (abnormally) such as by using his elbows, but not on the perforated lines, and preferably away from any writing or pictures. Since there is a use for toilet paper in such situations, a toilet paper roll is not considered muktzeh . Medication It is Rabbinically prohibited to take medication on Shabbos except under specific circumstances (that we enumerated in Days___—298). Therefore, medication is muktzeh for anyone that may not take it, but it is not muktzeh for the benefit of anyone that is permitted to take it. 2160 When a healthy person moves the medication for the benefit of one who is permitted to take it, 2161 he may not move it more than is necessary. Some Poskim say that he should only move it with a shinui (abnormally). 2162 Attached Plants Flowers, bushes, and branches of trees that were attached when Shabbos arrived remain muktzeh through Shabbos, even if they subsequently become detached. 2163 Therefore, even if a tree branch is blocking one’s path, he may not move it. 2164 However, he may walk normally on the path, even if vegetation or branches will move as a result, provided that they will not definitely become detached (which would constitute the Torah prohibition of kotzer (harvesting) [see Days___—221]). 2165 Note that unwanted grass or leaves that got stuck in one’s clothing or shoes are muktzeh . As always, one may remove them with a shinui (abnormally) even if he is not disgusted by them. If he is disgusted by them, such as if dog’s excrement is on his shoes, they may be removed under a separate leniency called graf shel re’i (see Day___). Detached flowers that were specifically designated before Shabbos to be smelled or are regularly smelled (such as particularly fragrant plants, like jas- mine) may be moved even if they were attached when Shabbos came in.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2151.

357,16/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MACHMAS GUFO,  CONTINUED","We discussed in the section on chisaron kis that one may designate a muktzeh item before Shabbos for a permitted use, and thereby use or move it on Shab- bos (see Day___). We saw that one need not speak it out — as long as one has decided in his mind before Shabbos that the item will be used for a permitted use, it is sufficient. Now, we will deal with the rules concerning designating an object that is muktzeh machmas gufo . Designating by Thinking There are two designations of a muktzeh item for permitted use: Designating Items for a Use That Is Regular or Common One may designate the object for a single Shabbos. • A stone has no intrinsic use, and is thus muktzeh . However, if one wishes to use a particular stone as a paperweight or a doorstop on Shabbos, he can decide before Shabbos that it will be used as such during Shab- bos, since stones are commonly used as paperweights and doorstops. It will not be muktzeh , even if use as a paperweight or doorstop is only intended to be temporary (for that Shabbos). 2166 • Sand has no intrinsic use, and is thus muktzeh . However, if one wishes to use sand to cover an unwanted item or eyesore on Shabbos, he can decide before Shabbos that it will be used as such during Shabbos, since sand is commonly used to cover things. Note: One may not put sand in a place where it can cause plants to grow since that is the melachah of zore’a (planting) (see Day___). • One cannot designate a raw potato to be a paperweight for a single Shabbos, since raw potatoes are not commonly used as paperweights. Designating Items for a Use That Is Not Regular or Common One must designate the object permanently for the uncommon use in order for it to no longer be muktzeh . • A broken appliance has no intrinsic use, and is therefore muktzeh . It is also not commonly used as a doorstop. If one wishes to use it to hold the door open, he should decide before Shabbos that it will always be used that way. This will render the broken appliance not muktzeh — but one must designate it for this use . Note that designating an item only works before Shabbos — but designating an item on Shabbos itself does not remove its muktzeh status. 2167",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2166.

358,17/07/2026,MUKTZEH: AUTOMATIC DESIGNATION  THROUGH USE,"We are discussing designating a muktzeh item for a permitted use in advance of Shabbos, so that it will not be considered muktzeh when Shabbos arrives. We will now consider whether using the object during the week for a use that is permitted on Shabbos automatically affects the muktzeh status without the need for designating it. Used Once If one used a muktzeh item once for a use that is permitted on Shabbos, it may no longer be muktzeh on Shabbos (even without designating it beforehand), depending on other factors: If one used it even once in a way that others often do, he may move it on Shabbos without designating it. 2168 • If one sits on a log during the week, he can move that log on Shabbos. This is because people often use logs for sitting, and it is considered as if he designated the log for a permitted use. 2169 But if one used something in a way that others hardly ever do, he may not move it on Shabbos until he properly designates it for that use before Shabbos. • Broken cell phones are not commonly used to keep napkins from flying away. Therefore, the phone is muktzeh on Shabbos. If one wishes to use the cell phone for such a purpose on Shabbos, he must designate it for that use before Shabbos. Regular Usage If one regularly uses an item during the week for a particular purpose that is permitted on Shabbos, this is as good as a designation, and it is no longer muktzeh. 2170 • If one regularly uses a broken cell phone to keep napkins from flying away or as a toy for a child, it is no longer considered muktzeh , and may be moved on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2168.

359,18/07/2026,MUKTZEH: GRAF SHEL RE’I,"Although we have seen that muktzeh items may not be handled or moved, Chazal incorporated a few exceptions. Graf shel Re’i When one is disgusted by the presence of something, one may move it even if it is muktzeh . Included in this leniency is something that is a genuine eyesore, is making a disturbing noise, has a bad smell, 2171 or would cause one embarrassment from visitors. However, it is preferable to get a non-Jew to move it instead. 2172 This category of muktzeh is known as graf shel re’i (container of refuse). Examples • An animal’s dirt box, or the dirt itself____ • A dead animal____ • Dirty plates, 2175 refuse, bones, 2176 and fruit and vegetable seeds____ • An open gas line that is causing a bad smell. (Note that one should turn it off as it is dangerous.) 2178 • A fly trap • Debris from schach that fell on a table____ • A smelly diaper____ • Impure water from netilas yadayim____ The objects on the list are all muktzeh , as they have no use. However, because they are disgusting, Chazal permitted moving them out of sight. In One’s Presence This leniency only applies when one is in the same vicinity as the item. One may not move it when it has no impact on anyone. 2182 • One who is leaving his house for the remainder of Shabbos may not remove a dirty diaper, as the presence of the diaper will not affect him.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2171.

360,19/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: GRAF SHEL RE’I,  CONTINUED","We have seen that Chazal permitted removing muktzeh items that are dis- gusting. Empty Garbage Cans An empty garbage can is considered a kli shemelachto l’issur , and one may only use it for a permitted purpose (garbage) or if he needs the space that it is occupying. 2183 The same applies to the cover. As it is empty, it does not have the leniency of graf shel re’i since it is not disgusting. Cans or Bags with Garbage If a garbage can that has garbage inside is a major nuisance, either because of the unpleasant sight of what it contains or because of the odor, one may re- move it. However, if the garbage can is not disgusting or repulsive, it may not be moved, as its contents have no use, rendering the entire can muktzeh machmas gufo. 2184 Therefore, one may generally not move a garbage can. (One may still put garbage in it without moving it.) If a garbage can or bag is full, and one has no other place to put garbage, he may take it outside if it is disturbing or repulsive (in a place where carrying is permitted). 2185 Creating a Graf shel Re’i Although one is allowed to move something that is already a graf shel re’i , one may not purposely cause a graf shel re’i to occur on Shabbos. • Aside from rat poison being muktzeh and the melachah of killing animals, one of the other problems with spreading rat poison out on Shabbos is that one is creating an eventual graf shel re’i — when the rat will eat the poison and die on the spot, the unwanted remains will be a graf shel re’i . 2186 Similarly, one may not go to the place where the graf shel re’i is specifically in order to allow himself to move it. 2187 However, if he did so (although he should not have), he may then move it. 2188 • If there is a dead rodent in an unoccupied room, one may not go to that room with the sole intention to use the leniency of removing a graf shel re’i . However, if he did, he may remove it. • If one is not currently disgusted by the smell of a moldy sandwich that is in a child’s bag, he cannot open the bag so as to smell it and thereby create a graf shel re’i . Eating If eating something automatically causes a graf shel re’i to exist, one may remove it, as it never existed before Shabbos. 2189 • One may remove nutshells or chicken bones even though those shells and bones were caused by separating shells or bones from real food (while avoiding borer issues).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2183.

361,20/07/2026,MUKTZEH: BASSIS L’DAVAR HAASSUR,"We have discussed three categories of muktzeh so far: 1. Kli shemelachto l’issur : an object that has multiple uses, but its primary use is forbidden on Shabbos_. Chisaron kis : something that the owner would not want lost or misused_. Machmas gufo : something that has no intrinsic use (either on Shabbos or ever) We have also discussed various leniencies: • For a kli shemelachto l’issur only: moving it to use it for a permitted use or for the space that it occupies • Shinui (all categories): moving it in an abnormal way • Graf shel re’i (all categories): removing disturbing or repulsive objects from the premises Bassis L’Davar HaAssur A non- muktzeh item that is deliberately used to hold a muktzeh item becomes muktzeh , and is treated as the same category as the muktzeh item it is support- ing. 2190 The word “ bassis ” translates as “support” — any type of support of a muktzeh item falls under this category. 2191 As long as the muktzeh item was on its base when Shabbos came in, it causes its base to also become muktzeh , even if the muktzeh item is subsequently removed from the bassis . • If a person intentionally placed a stone (without having designated it) on a pillow before Shabbos, the pillow becomes muktzeh when Shabbos comes in. Even if the stone will fall off or a child will move it, the pillow will remain muktzeh . • If a person intentionally lit Shabbos candles on a tray, the tray becomes muktzeh when Shabbos comes in. Even if the candles will go out or be removed, the tray remains muktzeh. 2192 • If an identification card was intentionally left on a table before Shabbos, the table becomes muktzeh when Shabbos comes in. There is a dispute whether this strict rule of bassis applies when the muktzeh item is a kli shemelachto l’issur , which itself has more leniencies. Certainly, all opinions agree that the bassis will enjoy the leniencies that apply to kli shem- elachto l’issur. 2193 • If a person intentionally left a hammer on a chair before Shabbos, the chair becomes muktzeh when Shabbos comes in. Even if the hammer will be removed, according to some opinions, the chair will remain muk- tzeh . However, because the hammer is a kli shemelachto l’issur and may be moved for a permitted use or for the space that it occupies, the chair certainly also possesses these leniencies. One may move the chair in order to sit on it, or if one needs the space that it is occupying. We will learn that there are a number of conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for an item to be rendered into a bassis .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2190.

362,21/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: BASSIS L’DAVAR HAASSUR,  CONTINUED","We have seen that a muktzeh item that was intentionally placed on a non- muk- tzeh object before Shabbos came in renders the supporting object muktzeh . A Support That Is Not a Bassis We will see that there are a number of conditions that must be met in order for something to become a bassis . For example, it only becomes a bassis if the muktzeh item was placed there intentionally; if it was left there by mistake or without the knowledge of the owner, it is not rendered a bassis. 2194 However, since the muktzeh object is still resting on the non- muktzeh object, there are rules that apply to moving the supporting object: 2195_. One may only move the supporting object if he needs it. 2196_. One should ideally only move the base after the muktzeh item is no longer on it. One can ask a non-Jew to remove the muktzeh item, 2197 or he can shake the base so that the muktzeh item falls off of it. 2198_. If these options are not possible, as a non-Jew is not available and the muktzeh item will get damaged if it falls in that place, one may carry the entire base with the muktzeh item on top of it to a place where the muktzeh item can safely fall. 2199 • Although a smartphone that was left on a table by mistake does not cause the table to become a bassis , the table may not be moved while the smartphone is on it. One should either tilt the table so that the smartphone drops or ask a non-Jew to remove it. He may then move the table freely. However, in a place where dropping the smartphone may break it, and there is no non-Jew available, one may carry the table to a place where the smartphone can fall safely. It is worth emphasizing that this leniency only applies in cases where the support does not become a bassis, and only if one actually needs the base (not merely to prevent the base from being damaged). 2200 • If one does not need the table, he may not shake off a smartphone from it simply to save it from getting damaged. • If a baby grabs a smartphone, one may not move the baby’s hand to prevent the smartphone from being damaged. However, as with all types of muktzeh , one may take the smartphone from the baby with a shinui (abnormally).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2194. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  309:4.

363,22/07/2026,MUKTZEH: CONDITIONS OF BASSIS  L’DAVAR HAASSUR,"We saw that when a muktzeh item is on a non- muktzeh item, the support may become a bassis if certain conditions are fulfilled. Several rules apply: 1. A bassis gets the same muktzeh status as the muktzeh item that it is supporting. 2. A base that is not a bassis (i.e., if it is missing a condition that would cause it to be a bassis ) may be moved after shaking off the muktzeh item or getting a non-Jew to remove it. Alternatively, if that is not possible, one may move both items to a place where the muktzeh item can fall safely, and the base may then be moved freely. We will now begin to discuss the conditions under which a base becomes a bassis . All seven conditions need to be fulfilled in order for the item to be a bassis : The Owner’s Intention The muktzeh item was left on the non- muktzeh item either by the owner or with his consent or desire. 2201 (It is not relevant who left it there — it may even have been a non-Jew. 2202 ) If the item was left there by someone else against the desire of the owner, it does not render the supporting item a bassis . • If a cleaning lady placed shoe polish on the Shabbos table, the table is not rendered a bassis as the owner did not desire that the shoe polish be left there. However, if the owner himself placed the shoe polish there to remain over Shabbos, the table is rendered a bassis . Deliberately Placed, or in the Regular Place The muktzeh item was left there deliberately, or in the place where the item is normally stored. However, if a person merely dropped it there haphazardly, and it is not the place where it is normally stored, the supporting item is not considered a bassis . 2203 • If one intentionally places expensive car keys in a basket near the front door, the basket becomes a bassis , as one intentionally put the keys there. Even if one put them there without thinking, but that is the place where they are normally stored, the basket becomes a bassis . However, if one left the keys on a cushion by mistake, the cushion is not rendered a bassis since it was done accidentally and it is not a normal place to keep car keys. • If one leaves money in a wallet, the wallet becomes a bassis and may not be moved (even if the money falls out). This is true even if one never put the money there intentionally, since it is a normal place to keep money. 2204 Supports the Muktzeh Object The base serves the muktzeh item on top of it. However, if the muktzeh item supports or serves the base, the base is not rendered a bassis . 2205 • A silver tray for candlesticks is clearly there to hold them and catch any oil, wax, or spark (which are all muktzeh ) that falls. Because the silver tray serves the muktzeh item on top of it, it is rendered a bassis . • An undesignated stone placed on a pile of papers to keep them from blowing away is clearly there for the benefit of the papers. Therefore, the papers are not rendered a bassis of the stone that is on top them. 2206 We will discuss more conditions in the next section.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2201.

It was left there by the owner, or with his consent or desire. 2. It was left there intentionally, or that is the normal place to store it. 3. The base benefits the muktzeh item that is on top of it. We will now discuss more conditions of bassis . All seven conditions need to be fulfilled in order for the item to be a bassis . As Shabbos Begins The muktzeh item was left or was intended to be left there from before sunset until actual nightfall (three stars). 2207 The duration of this depends on the place. In Eretz Yisrael, it is the fifteen to twenty minutes from shkiyah (sunset), 2208 but in other places, where it takes longer to get dark, it may be later. However, if the object was removed any time before nightfall, or if the person did not intend to leave it there until nightfall, the supporting object is not rendered a bassis . 2209 Even if it somehow was placed there on Shabbos (not before sunset), it is not rendered a bassis . 2210 (See the footnote regarding cases of great need or possible loss. 2211 ) • If one placed a wallet on a pillow in a discreet room with the intention of keeping it there throughout Shabbos, the pillow is rendered a bassis . However, if a child happened to remove the wallet before nightfall, the pillow is not rendered a bassis . Furthermore, if one had instructed a non-Jew to remove it before nightfall, and the non-Jew forgot to do so, the pillow is still not rendered a bassis . If a non-Jew placed a wallet on a pillow on Shabbos, it is not rendered a bassis . AS SHABBOS BEGINS The muktzeh item is more valuable or more significant to the owner than the supporting object. However, if the base is more valuable or more significant, it is not rendered a bassis . 2212 • If a wad of bills was intentionally left on a table, the table is rendered a bassis , as the money is more significant than the table. However, if there were only a few coins on the table, the table is not rendered a bassis . 2213 If a few coins were intentionally left in a stroller, the stroller does not becomes a bassis , as the stroller is worth more than the coins. We will discuss more conditions in the next section.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2207. Mishnah Berurah  309:19.

365,24/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: CONDITIONS OF BASSIS  L’DAVAR HAASSUR, CONTINUED","We have discussed five conditions that are required to render an object that is supporting muktzeh a bassis : 1. It was left there by the owner, or with his consent or desire. 2. It was left there intentionally, or it is the normal place to store it. 3. The base benefits or serves the muktzeh item that is on top of it. 4. It was left there or was intended to be left there from before sunset until nightfall. 5. The muktzeh item is more valuable or significant to the owner than the supporting object. There are two more conditions that must be fulfilled in order to render a supporting object a bassis . All seven conditions need to be fulfilled in order for the item to be a bassis . THE MOST SIGNIFICANT There is no other non- muktzeh item also resting on the supporting object that is more valuable or significant. However, if there is a non- muktzeh item on the supporting object that is more valuable than the muktzeh item, the base is not rendered a bassis . 2214 • If one intentionally left a basic pen in his tallis bag, the bag is not a bassis , as the tallis is more valuable than the pen. However, if one left a wad of bills in the tallis bag, the bag is considered a bassis . (One may still remove the tallis without moving the bag.) • If one intentionally placed Shabbos candles on the table, the table is considered a bassis . However, if he also placed a challah on the table, the table is not considered a bassis , as the challah is considered more significant (because of the mitzvah to have a seudah on Shabbos), even though it is lower in value. 2215 On the Primary Part of the Supporting Object The muktzeh item must be on the primary part of the supporting object. However, if the muktzeh item is resting on an insignificant part of the supporting object, it does not render the supporting object a bassis . 2216 • If one intentionally left a wad of bills in a table drawer, the drawer is considered a bassis . Regarding the table, if the drawer is not removable, it is nullified to the table, and does not cause the table to be a bassis . But if the drawer is removable, it is a significant item in its own right and not simply nullified to the table, and so the table is a bassis . Note: As long as there is a more valuable or significant item on the table, the table does not become a bassis . 2217 • If one left a wad of bills in his shirt pocket, the shirt is considered a bassis , as the pocket is sewn on top of the shirt, and is not merely an extension of the shirt. One may not move the shirt, even if the bills have somehow been removed. • However, if one left a wad of bills in his jacket pocket, the jacket is not considered a bassis , as those pockets are a separate, insignificant extension of the jacket. In such a case, one should shake out the bills immediately. If it would cause embarrassment or they will get stolen from that place, one may wear it until he reaches an appropriate place to shake the bills out, and then continue wearing it. 2218 • If a visitor who does not yet keep Shabbos arrives, it is permitted to hang up the coat, as the coat itself is not muktzeh, and shaking out the visitor’s coat would be inappropriate. 2219 In order for an object that is supporting muktzeh to be rendered a bassis , all seven conditions must be met.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2214.

366,25/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: BASSIS L’DAVAR HAASSUR,  CONTINUED","We will now discuss a few practical applications of the halachos of a bassis l’davar ha’assur . Medicine Chest Doors We have seen that medication is muktzeh unless a person is ill enough to war- rant being permitted to take them. Therefore, if there is no need for medication, the door to a medicine chest is considered a bassis , and may not be opened. 2220 Schoolbags If a schoolbag only has muktzeh items inside, the bag is rendered a bassis . However, if there is a Chumash inside, or other permissible objects that are more significant, the bag is not rendered a bassis , and one may shake out the muktzeh in order to move the bag (unless it is borer ). Furthermore, one may remove the non- muktzeh item if it is more significant, being careful not to move the bag. Tablecloths If a muktzeh item was intentionally placed on a tablecloth, the table becomes a bassis . There is a dispute as to whether the tablecloth also becomes a bassis . In cases of need, one can be lenient and move the tablecloth, as it is there primarily to serve the table, not the muktzeh item. 2221 Shtenders (Lecterns) If one intentionally placed a muktzeh item on a shtender , the shtender is ren- dered a bassis . However, if the shtender has a hinged compartment or storage space on the bottom, and the muktzeh item was left on the top surface of the shtender , one may be lenient, and the bottom compartment is not considered a bassis . 2222 Refrigerator Doors Ideally, one should not keep muktzeh items in the refrigerator door, as this renders it a bassis . However, if one did so, he may still open the door. 2223 (See Day___ regarding problems of creating an electric current by opening refrig- erator doors.) Key Rings Ideally, one should remove muktzeh keys (such as car keys) from his key ring before Shabbos. However, if he did not do so, he may move the key ring by grasping the non- muktzeh keys only. One should not remove the muktzeh keys on Shabbos, unless they can be easily shaken off without handling them. 2224 Tzedakah Boxes If one left a tzedakah box on the bimah in shul before Shabbos, the bimah is unlikely to become a bassis , as he surely intended to remove it before Shabbos. However, if one had assumed that the bimah would not be used over Shabbos and thus left it there intentionally, the bimah is considered a bassis , and may not be moved.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2220.

367,26/07/2026,MUKTZEH: MEVATEL KLI M’HEICHANO,"We have covered the main categories of muktzeh and their respective le- niencies. We will now discuss the Rabbinic prohibition known as mevatel kli m’heichano — taking a previously usable object and rendering it unusable (i.e., making something muktzeh ). Mevatel Kli M’Heichano Chazal prohibited one to cause a usable object to become useless____ — that is, make something muktzeh . 2226 • Once one has finished eating nuts, and the shells are on the table, he may not transfer them onto a ceramic or glass plate because they are muktzeh in their own right, and will render the plate muktzeh as well. Rather, if they are disgusting and fall into the category of graf shel re’i , he may take them directly and throw them into the garbage. If there are any non- muktzeh items on the plate, the plate will never be rendered useless and one may put them on even if they are not disgusting. Some Poskim rule that disposable plates are anyway considered intrinsically insignificant and are thus not subject to this halachah of being made to become useless. Therefore, one may put the shells onto a disposable plate. 2227 • One may not place a cup under dripping wax candles in order to catch the wax, 2228 as doing so causes the cup to become muktzeh . • One may not place a bucket to catch dripping water from an air con- ditioner, as that water never existed before Shabbos and is therefore muktzeh (because of nolad ), thus causing the bucket to become muk- tzeh . 2229 To avoid this, one must first put a fork or some other more valuable non- muktzeh item in the bucket that will prevent the bucket from becoming muktzeh . 2230 Normal Use One may use an object normally even if doing so will render it muktzeh. 2231 • One may drop a rag onto dirty liquid in order to soak it up. Although the rag will become muktzeh (since it will become so wet that picking it up will be a problem of sechitah [see Days___ and___]), that is the primary use of the rag. This is also why throwing garbage into a garbage can is permitted. • One may put shells or pits into a bag that is dedicated for that purpose, as that is the way that the bag is used. Temporarily Unusable One may not cause an object to become unusable, even if it is only tempo- rary, and it will once again be usable before the end of Shabbos. However, there may be mitigating factors, such as a major monetary loss, that would permit one to do so (one should consult a Rav in such a case). 2232 • If one mistakenly picked up money on Shabbos, he may not place it into an unused box or cup, as doing so will render it muktzeh . Howev- er, if it is a lot of money, and he has a way to remove it before Shabbos ends (by moving it abnormally, or getting a non-Jew to move it), a Rav should be consulted.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2225.

368,27/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MEVATEL KLI M’HEICHANO,  CONTINUED","We have seen that making something unusable (i.e., muktzeh ) is Rabbinically forbidden. A Non-Vessel We have discussed that before Shabbos, one may designate a muktzeh item that otherwise has no purpose, allowing the item to be moved on Shabbos. Once such an item has been designated for a purpose, one may not place a muktzeh item on it, as doing so will once again render it unusable. 2233 • If one designated a stone for use as a doorstop before Shabbos, he may not drop on top of it a muktzeh item that was accidently picked up. Placing a Kli SheMelachto L’Issur onto a Non-Muktzeh Object A kli shemelachto l’issur is an object whose a primary use is prohibited on Shabbos (see Days___—311). We mentioned that this category has two le- niencies: one may use it for a permitted purpose, and one may move it in order to use the space that it occupies. The prohibition of making a previously usable object unusable does not apply when placing a kli shemelachto l’issur on it, as the kli shemelachto l’issur may be moved in its own right if one wishes to use the item underneath. 2234 • If one cracked nuts with a hammer, he may then place the hammer on a plate. Although the plate now has a muktzeh item on top of it and is currently unusable, he is not violating the prohibition of mevatel kli m’heichano , as he may move the hammer if he wishes to use the plate.WITH A NON SIGNIFICANT NON-MUKTZEH ITEM As we discussed (in Day___), a supporting object is not rendered a bassis if there is a more significant non- muktzeh item on or in the supporting object. Therefore, in cases where it is permitted to move a muktzeh item, one may place it into an object that has more significant non- muktzeh items in it, and thereby avoid the prohibition of mevatel kli m’heichano . 2235 • If a screw fell out of one’s glasses into his hands, it is muktzeh . While it is still in his hands, he may, without putting it down, place it into his drawer if the drawer already has clothes in it. • Although putting an empty bucket under a dripping air conditioner is forbidden, one may do so after placing a bottle of wine in it first, which renders it movable even though there is muktzeh water in it. 2236 Rendering a Bassis Indirectly It is permitted to remove all non- muktzeh items from the surface even though it will indirectly cause the supporting object that remains to become muktzeh . 2237 The prohibition of mevatel kli m’heichano only applies to placing the muktzeh item on the non- muktzeh item, or the non- muktzeh item in a place where the muktzeh item will end up on top of it, not through the removal of non- muktzeh items. • One may pour out all of the milk from a container, even though doing so turns the usable milk container into something useless and muktzeh . (Some Poskim rule that the empty milk container becomes muktzeh machmas gufo and must be thrown away while in one’s hand [see Day___], unless it qualifies as a graf shel re’i [see Day___]). • One may clear a table, leaving only the candlesticks, even though it will then be prohibited to move the table. (If the candlesticks were the only objects on the table before nightfall, the table is already a bassis , and may not be moved. However, if there were also challos on the table before nightfall, it has not been rendered a bassis , but it will become muktzeh if the other, usable objects are removed.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2233.

369,28/07/2026,MUKTZEH: MIGU D’ISKATZAI,"We have discussed a number of different categories of muktzeh and their leniencies. We will now discuss a category of muktzeh known as migu d’iskatzai . Muktzeh as Shabbos Came In Something that was muktzeh from shkiyah (sunset) until nightfall (three stars) remains muktzeh throughout Shabbos, even if the physical factor that caused it to be muktzeh was removed. 2238 Practical Applications • A lit candle is muktzeh for several reasons. 2239 Even if the flame goes out on Shabbos, it remains muktzeh for the duration of Shabbos. 2240 • A mezuzah that was attached to the wall when Shabbos came in is muk- tzeh since it has a specific place and was set aside there from before Shabbos. 2241 Even if it falls on Shabbos, it remains muktzeh , but can and should be picked up with a shinui (abnormally). A wrapped mezu- zah (that was not attached to a wall, and thus set aside) has the same halachah as any holy writings and sefarim , and is not muktzeh since one can read it. 2242 • Wet or soaked clothes are muktzeh , as handling them is likely to cause squeezing, which is a Torah prohibition. Even if they unexpectedly dry out on Shabbos, they remain muktzeh for the duration of Shabbos. 2243 However, if the clothes were not so wet before Shabbos, or he hung them up before Shabbos, expecting the hot summer sun to dry them out during Shabbos, some Poskim rule that the clothes are no longer muktzeh once they are dry. 2244 • A passport is muktzeh because of the value it represents to the owner ( chisaron kis ). Even if it was torn on Shabbos, rendering it unusable and thereby removing the factor that caused it to be muktzeh , it remains muktzeh for the duration of Shabbos. • Flowers or fruit that are attached to their growth source are muktzeh . Even if they fell off or a non-Jew picked them, they remain muktzeh for the duration of Shabbos. 2245 If they were already designated, see Day___. • Sukkah decorations and schach are muktzeh , as they are Halachically considered part of the sukkah, which was set aside for the mitzvah for sukkah. If the decorations or schach fall, they remain muktzeh , and may not be moved. 2246 However, if one specified before Shabbos that he wishes to make use of the decorations, he may use them. 2247 (This is a special leniency regarding sukkah decorations.) Moreover, if they fall on the table and make a disgusting mess ( graf shel re’i ), one may move them. 2248 One may always move them on Chol HaMoed when it is not Shabbos. • Fruit that is not ripe has no purpose, and is therefore muktzeh . However, if it is reasonably likely that it will become ripe during Shabbos, it may be eaten, as it is not considered as having been fully set apart from Shabbos use. (This is similar to the leniency that we discussed regarding slightly wet clothes that would probably dry on a summer day.) 2249 NOTE: We will learn a limitation of this rule in Day___.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2238.

370,29/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MIGU D’ISKATZAI,  CONTINUED","We have seen that something that was muktzeh as Shabbos commenced and through nightfall remains muktzeh throughout Shabbos, even if the factor causing it to be muktzeh is removed. If the factor causing the object to become muktzeh was Halachic (and not a physical change), it is no longer considered muktzeh once the factor is removed. Tevel Fruit from Eretz Yisrael that has not been tithed is muktzeh . However, the factor causing fruit to be muktzeh is not physical — it is a Halachic requirement. Although tithing on Shabbos is forbidden, if the fruit was tithed by mistake on Shabbos (the halachah is that it does work), the fruit is no longer muktzeh . 2250 Yom Tov That Falls Out After Shabbos Uncooked, inedible food is muktzeh on Shabbos, as it has no use and may not be prepared on Shabbos. However, on Yom Tov that directly follows Shabbos, that food will no longer be muktzeh , as one may cook on Yom Tov if necessary. This is regardless of the fact that the food was muktzeh from when Yom Tov came in. 2251 This is because the factor that made it muktzeh was a Halachic one — the fact that cooking is prohibited on Shabbos — not a physical one. Chametz When Shabbos Falls Out After Pesach The same concept applies regarding chametz when the day after Pesach is Shabbos: the chametz (such as that which was in a non-Jew’s house) is muktzeh from when Shabbos begins. But once nightfall arrives, such chametz becomes permissible, as the chametz was muktzeh for a Halachic reason, not for a physical reason. (Note: Chametz that was sold will not become permissible until after Shabbos, as it may only be purchased back after Shabbos.) 2252 An Object That Became Muktzeh on Shabbos If something was useful when Shabbos came in and became muktzeh on Shabbos because it became useless, and then somehow became useful again, it is no longer considered muktzeh . 2253 Only objects that were muktzeh when Shabbos came in remain muktzeh . 2254 • Clothes that became drenched (and therefore muktzeh ) on Shabbos, and then dried out, are no longer considered muktzeh .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2250.

371,30/07/2026,"MUKTZEH: MIGU D’ISKATZAI,  CONTINUED - FOOD","Food Edible food that is frozen may be muktzeh , such as frozen soup (if one would not eat it in that state), because it has no use on Shabbos. However, if it would become edible if it would be defrosted, one may move it in order to defrost it. 2257 (Note that the frozen raw foods in the freezer are muktzeh and may not be moved at all. Furthermore, a cluttered freezer with muktzeh and non- muktzeh items may also present borer issues.) • One may remove frozen pita from the freezer in order to defrost it and eat it on Shabbos, even though it was not edible when Shabbos came in. Clothes on a Drying Rack Soaked clothes are usually muktzeh . However, if clothes are on a drying rack when Shabbos comes in, and will certainly dry out during Shabbos, the clothes will no longer be muktzeh once they are dry enough to be worn. 2258 (One may not set a noisy weekday machine, such as a dryer, to operate on Shabbos. Also, on Shabbos, one may not hang up wet clothes from a washing machine even if it completed its cycle before Shabbos, as it would appear to an onlooker as if he did laundry on Shabbos, which constitutes the Torah prohi- bition of melaben . 2259 ) Candlesticks An exception to this is candlesticks. Although one knows that candles will eventually go out on Shabbos, the candlesticks remain muktzeh because they were a bassis for the candles when Shabbos began. 2260",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2255.

372,31/07/2026,MUKTZEH: MACHMAS MITZVAH,"Any object that is designated for a mitzvahthat is not performed on Shabbos is muktzeh . This category is known as muktzeh machmas mitzvah . The Four Species We do not shake the Four Species on Shabbos. 2261 Therefore, they are muk- tzeh on Shabbos. 2262 There is a dispute regarding an esrog. According to some Poskim , since it is normal to smell an esrog, it has an intrinsic use aside from the mitzvah, and so, it is not muktzeh . 2263 Other Poskim rule that nowadays esrogim are not commonly smelled — on the contrary, people are careful not to handle their esrog except to perform the mitzvah, and so it muktzeh . 2264 NOTE: During Sukkos, one can make a brachah before smelling an esrog, 2265 but he must not smell it while performing the mitzvah. 2266 Some are stringent not to smell it at all during Sukkos. 2267 Shofar We do not blow the shofar on Shabbos. Therefore, it is muktzeh on Shabbos. However, because it is a vessel that is capable of holding something, it is consid- ered a kli shemelachto l’issur , and can be moved in order to use it for a permitted purpose, or to use the space that it occupies. 2268 On Rosh HaShanah (that is not Shabbos), the shofar is not muktzeh at all. However, one may not use it for any purpose other than the mitzvah of blowing. 2269 Megillas Esther Chazal decreed that the Megillah may not be read on Shabbos, even if it is Purim. 2270 Therefore, on Purim that comes out on Shabbos, because Chazal spe- cifically prohibited doing so, the Megillah is muktzeh . (Note that only Shushan Purim can fall out on Shabbos.) However, on every other Shabbos, the Megillah is like any other book of Tanach , and it is not muktzeh . 2271 These halachos apply to a kosher parchment Megillah . A printed copy (with which one may not fulfill the mitzvah) is never muktzeh . When Purim falls out on Motzaei Shabbos, one should preferably bring the Megillah to shul before Shabbos. If he did not, he may only do so on Shabbos (within a valid eiruv ) if he uses it on Shabbos — reading a verse from it at the destination will suffice. This is because one may not prepare on Shabbos for events that will occur after Shabbos. 2272 Matzah on Erev Pesach Although eating matzah on erev Pesach is forbidden, this does not apply to very young children. 2273 Therefore, matzah is not muktzeh on the Shabbos that falls out on erev Pesach (though some Poskim are stringent). 2274 However, matzos that were designated for the Seder night may be muktzeh if one is concerned about damage to them. 2275 An Invalid Sefer Torah A Sefer Torah that is invalid and must be corrected is muktzeh , mainly be- cause it is very valuable, and one would not want it lost or damaged. However, in a case where there is a use for it, such as reading shnayim mikra v’echad targum (see Day__) or to protect it from being damaged, one may move it for that purpose. On Simchas Torah, the custom is to dance even with an invalid Sefer Torah , and so, it is certainly not muktzeh . 2276",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2261.

373,01/08/2026,MUKTZEH: OWNED BY A NON-JEW - FOOD,"Food of a Non-Jew Any food that a Jew may not get any benefit from is muktzeh , even if it be- longs to a non-Jew. 2279 • A Jew may not eat or benefit from chametz on Pesach. One may not sell it or give it to his workers. Therefore, the chametz that belongs to a non-Jew is also muktzeh . If chametz falls into one’s property on Yom Tov, he may not move it (even with a shinui ), as he may come to eat it. Additionally, he must cover it with a vessel. 2280 However, food that a Jew is allowed to benefit from is not muktzeh , even if he is not allowed to eat it. Therefore, it may be moved if necessary. 2281 • Non-kosher meat may not be eaten by a Jew, but he is allowed to benefit from it. It is not muktzeh (if it is cooked), but one may only move it for a purpose, such as to feed a dog. A Non-Jew Rendering Something Muktzeh If a non-Jew sets aside a useful item so that it will not be used, that item still does not become muktzeh . 2282 Furthermore, even if a non-Jew regards an item as being valuable (in a way that it would have been considered muktzeh machmas chisaron kis by a Jew), the item is still not rendered muktzeh . Similarly, a non-Jew cannot render a supporting object a bassis unless he put the muktzeh item on it for the Jew and with his consent. 2283 • When a Jew puts merchandise in his warehouse before Shabbos, it is usually rendered muktzeh . However, if a non-Jew did the same thing for himself, it is not rendered muktzeh , as there is no Halachic concept of a non-Jew setting something aside for Shabbos. 2284 • If a non-Jew leaves an expensive drill on a table, the table is not consid- ered a bassis . Once the drill has somehow been removed from the table, one can move the table. However, if he placed the drill there for the Jew and with the Jew’s consent, the table is rendered a bassis . 2285",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2277. Mishnah Berurah  310:12.

374,02/08/2026,MUKTZEH: IN ERROR,"There are two types of errors that impact an object’s muktzeh status. An Error in the Facts If one thought that something was unusable, and thus put it out of his mind (which generally causes and object to become muktzeh ), and then, on Shabbos realized that it was, in fact, usable, it is not muktzeh . 2286 • A person thought that a fruit was rotten. In his mind, he set it aside be- fore Shabbos, rendering it muktzeh . On Shabbos, he noticed that some of the fruit was in fact perfectly edible. He may eat or move the fruit, as it is not considered muktzeh . • A person assumed that laundry on the drying rack was still wet, and had no chance of drying over Shabbos. On Shabbos, he noticed that they had, in fact, never been wet to start with. He may move or wear them. An Error in the Halachah If a person mistakenly assumed that the Halachic status of an item was muk- tzeh , and so, put it out of his mind, but on Shabbos he discovered that it actually was not muktzeh , it is not considered muktzeh , even though he had set it aside from use before Shabbos. 2287 • Before, Shabbos, a person assumed that an empty Coke bottle is muk- tzeh , and set it aside. On Shabbos, he read that an empty Coke bottle is actually not muktzeh . He may move the bottle.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2286. Mishnah Berurah  310:17.

375,03/08/2026,MUKTZEH: FIRE,"We will discuss a few practical points regarding fire and how it relates to the halachos of muktzeh . All the halachos below apply to a situation where there is no danger to life — where there is a danger to a Jewish life, one can and must do whatever is possible to save it. Fire Anything that is alight is considered muktzeh . 2288 Anything upon which a flame rests, including the candlestick, oil, and wick, becomes a bassis to the muktzeh flame, and is also muktzeh . 2289 However, on Yom Tov, when it is permitted to use and transfer a flame in order to cook, a flame is not muktzeh . 2290 Heating Elements, Coils, and Filaments When we discussed the melachah of maavir (lighting a fire) (see Days___—274), we saw that causing something to become red-hot is included in the prohibition, and such heat is Halachically considered a flame. There is a discussion among the Poskim whether red-hot filaments or coils are considered fire with regards to muktzeh . It is advisable to avoid moving such items at all on Shabbos. 2291 Incandescent Bulbs The old battery-operated flashlights (with an incandescent bulb) have red-hot filaments. Such a flashlight is therefore considered a kli shemelachto l’issur , and may be moved to use for a permitted purpose or for the space that it occupies only. Emergency Lights Emergency fluorescent lights that are plugged into the wall and turn on automatically when the power is off fall under the category of kli shemelachto l’issur , and may only be moved in order to use them or for the space they occupy. One must not disconnect them from the wall unless the power is off. 2292",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2288. Mishnah Berurah  279:1.

376,04/08/2026,MUKTZEH: ELECTRIC APPLIANCES,"As we mentioned, causing something to become red-hot is included in the melachah of maavir (lighting a fire), even if there is no flame. There is a discussion among the Poskim whether they are muktzeh , and it is thus advisable not to move them on Shabbos. Here are more practical applications of this. Electric Appliances • A hot plate that has red-hot elements inside is considered muktzeh and should not be moved. One may move it abnormally. However, the door of an oven is not muktzeh . 2293 • An oil heater that houses burning oil and hot elements inside is muk- tzeh , and one may only move it abnormally. If the elements inside are not red-hot, it is a kli shemelachto l’issur . One can only move it to use it or for the space it occupies. Therefore, one can draw the heater closer to him if he is cold, or away from him if he is hot, and if it is in the way, one can move it. 2294 • There is a dispute among the Poskim regarding whether an urn’s heating elements cause the urn to be a bassis . 2295 On one hand, there are red-hot elements inside. On the other hand, the water is equally important, and also, the urn is a usable vessel in its own right. It is praiseworthy to be stringent and regard the urn as a kli shemelachto l’issur , and thus only move it to use it or for the space it occupies. The faucet of the urn is not muktzeh . 2296 Note that any smart urns that have computer chips measuring the temperature and water level may not be used on Shabbos, as any use of the urn results in a change on the display screen. • An electric blanket may be used on Shabbos. The elements inside do not become red-hot. The blanket is usable and significant in its own right, and the principle of bassis does not apply. 2297 Obviously, it must be turned on or put on a timer before Shabbos, and one must be certain not to touch the controls. Whenever one moves electric items, he must be careful not to unplug them from the socket. It is worth mentioning that since some Poskim are stringent and rule that any item that contains fire is muktzeh — whether a flame or red-hot elements — it is best to avoid moving this type of item.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2293.

377,05/08/2026,MUKTZEH: PREVENTING A LOSS,"Generally, one may not transgress a prohibition even if it will cause a mone- tary loss. This is true with regard to muktzeh as well. 2298 However, Chazal waived Rabbinic prohibitions in a case of a monetary loss when the situation is accom- panied by other factors. Note that these halachos can be quite detailed, and one should consult a Rav in any case where they may be applicable. Moving Muktzeh with a Shinui As we have discussed, one may always move a muktzeh item abnormally____ (see Day___ for parameters and details). This is one way that a person can save a muktzeh item to avoid a potential loss. • If one left the car door open and there are valuable items inside, he may close the door using his chin — but only if there will be no electric effects such as lights turning off or electric locks becoming activated. One must also be careful of maris ayin , ensuring that an onlooker will not think that he is doing a prohibited act. Thus, one must only close the door provided that no one who does not understand the halachah is looking. 2300 • If one finds a wallet, he can kick it to a place of safety (if there is a valid eiruv ), as kicking a wallet is an abnormal way to move it. 2301 Asking a Non-Jew to Move Muktzeh Valuable Muktzeh Items One may tell a non-Jew to move a very valuable muktzeh item for the fol- lowing reasons: in order to save it from being ruined, for a mitzvah, or if it is causing distress. 2302 One may not ask a non-Jew to move a muktzeh item for no reason or if it is not valuable. • If one forgot his smartphone on the patio table before Shabbos, and it begins to rain, he can ask a non-Jew to bring it to safety. Cheap Muktzeh Items Regarding a muktzeh item that is not valuable, one may only ask a non-Jew to move it in order to use the place that it occupies or to use the item for a permitted purpose (regardless of which category of muktzeh it is). 2303 • If one needs a table that has a stone on it, he may ask a non-Jew to move it. • One may ask a non-Jew to move a hot plate closer to a table, if necessary. However, he may not ask him to adjust the controls. For a Mitzvah One may ask a non-Jew to move a muktzeh item for the purpose of a mitzvah. 2304 • One may ask a non-Jew to move a grill in order to make room for visi- tors who need a place to sleep or eat, which constitutes the mitzvah of chessed (lovingkindness).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2298.

378,06/08/2026,MUKTZEH: FINDING MUKTZEH,"We have seen that one may save any muktzeh item by moving it with a shinui (abnormally). We also mentioned that one may even ask a non-Jew to move it if it is very valuable. It is important to note that this only applies within a valid eiruv or in an area that will not involve the Torah melachah of hotzaah (carrying), such as an extremely public space (see Day___ for details). Note that it is an obligation to check one’s pockets for muktzeh items before Shabbos arrives. 2305 Finding Muktzeh in One’s Pockets Sometimes a person discovers on Shabbos that he has left a muktzeh item in his Shabbos clothes by mistake. (The garment is not considered a bassis , as the muktzeh item was left there unintentionally.) In such a case, one should try to shake out the item from the garment and leave it wherever it falls. 2306 However, if the muktzeh item will break by being shaken out, or it will constitute a hazard in that place or risk being stolen, or it is embarrassing to empty out the pocket there, one can continue wearing the garment until he arrives at a place where it can be dropped. 2307 • If a person discovers an MP3 player in his pocket while walking outside on Shabbos, he should shake it out before continuing, if possible. If it will break or can be stolen, he can continue wearing the coat until he finds a suitable place to drop it. (See Day___ for the halachah regarding if one is in a reshus harabim or karmelis without an eiruv .) Finding Muktzeh Outside If a person finds a muktzeh object that does not belong to him, he may not pick it up. 2308 As always, he can move it abnormally. Alternatively, he can cover it with a non- muktzeh item and claim it after Shabbos. If it is valuable, he can ask a non-Jew to pick it up and keep it for him. 2309 Note that according to most Poskim , the prohibition of muktzeh overrides the mitzvah to return a lost item, and therefore, one cannot actively return a muktzeh item belonging to someone he knows. 2310 • If one finds a stack of bills outside and he is worried that kicking it will ruin it, he can ask a non-Jew to pick it up and keep it for him. He can also cover it with something opaque, in the hope that it will still be there after Shabbos. • If a person finds his friend’s checkbook or credit card on the ground, he may move it abnormally. Alternatively, because it is valuable, he can ask a non-Jew to move it for him.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2305. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  252:6.

379,07/08/2026,MUKTZEH: CHILDREN,"Educating Children We will now discuss the prohibition of muktzeh as it relates to children. Children fall into two categories. Older Children A child who understands the concepts of Shabbos and muktzeh is bound by the prohibition of muktzeh . (This is generally around the age of five or six.) At that point, a parent is obligated to teach their child not to play with games, toys, or any other objects that are muktzeh . Younger Children A child below the age of understanding may play with all types of toys. Nevertheless, an adult may not hand a muktzeh object to a child. 2311 Still, for the sake of the sanctity of Shabbos, it is advisable not to leave any muktzeh toys available to play with on Shabbos, even for those children that are not yet old enough to keep the halachos of muktzeh . Toys and Muktzeh All categories of muktzeh apply to toys, just like they apply to anything else. Therefore, a toy without any intrinsic use (such as a random stone brought home by a child on Shabbos) is muktzeh machmas gufo and may not be moved, unless it was designated before Shabbos by an adult (a child has no power to designate an object____ ). An electronic toy is usually a kli shemelachto l’issur . However, one may not move it if doing so will cause melachah , such as the toy lighting up. If it is off and it was designated for Shabbos use (such as in the case of an old, retired cell phone with no charger), one can move it to use it for a permitted purpose, or to use the space that it is occupying. 2313 Moreover, we will discuss that there is a Rabbinic prohibition to generate noise on Shabbos (see Day___). Therefore, any toy that generates noise (even mechanically, such as a rattle) is also usually a kli shemelachto l’issur even if mov- ing it will not produce lights, sparks, or electric sounds. Some Poskim rule that if a child is crying or extremely anxious, one may give them a toy even if it generates a noise, as long as that noise is not due to an electric current. 2314 • One may not blow a whistle on Shabbos, but one may move it in order to sit in the place that it currently occupies. • One can theoretically place a baby doll that flashes lights in front of a three-year-old to play with, as that is its normal usage, 2315 provided that doing so will not cause the lights or noise to play. In practice, it is best to have special Shabbos toys for the child to play with instead. • If a bicycle is in the way, one may move it. 2316 • A pebble that a six-year-old uses as a toy is muktzeh , and may not be moved by an adult. However, if he found it before Shabbos and an adult designated it as a fitting toy for him or it was used as such, it is no longer muktzeh . Chisaron Kis In rare cases, a toy is both very valuable and has a designated place, and is therefore muktzeh machmas chisaron kis . • An expensive tablet that was given to a child is muktzeh . • An expensive new keyboard that was given to a child is muktzeh .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2311.

380,08/08/2026,MUKTZEH: A CHILD  HOLDING MUKTZEH;   ITEMS THAT ARE NOT MUKTZEH;   TOUCHING MUKTZEH,"A Child Holding Muktzeh One may not pick up a child that is holding muktzeh . The child must first drop the item. However, if the child will get frantic if he is not picked up, one may pick him up even if he is holding an object that is any of most types of muktzeh (with the exception of chisaron kis , as we will discuss). 2317 Note that this leniency does not apply if the child will merely start to cry — one may only pick up the child if he will get anxious or borderline hysterical. If the child is holding a valuable item ( chisaron kis ), one may not pick him up even if he is getting frantic. One is not even allowed to hold the child’s hand. This is because Chazal were concerned that the adult would pick up the item if it fell. 2318 Note that the child discussed here is up to the age of six or seven. 2319 It is forbidden to pick up an older child that is holding muktzeh . • If a two-year-old is frantically scared because of a spider, but he currently has a stone or candle in his hand, one may pick him up. However, if the child is relatively calm, or if he is holding a wallet full of money, one may not pick him up. Moving an Item That Is Not Muktzeh One is always permitted to move Torah books and regular household objects such as cups, spoons, clothing, and jewelry, even if there is no purpose for doing so. 2320 However, one may not move things that are not regular household items, even if they are not muktzeh . That said, any use is sufficient — to play with it, to mindlessly fiddle with it, for the space that it occupies, to use it (even in an unusual manner), or to save it from loss. 2321 Touching Muktzeh One is allowed to touch and sit on a muktzeh object, provided that doing so will not move it. Similarly, one may place something on a muktzeh object. If leaning on the car will not move it or part of it, it is permitted. 2322 Bear in mind that one may not lean on or get direct usage out of a tree (see Day___).

381,09/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI  (BENEFITING FROM OR ASKING A NON-JEW TO DO MELACHAH),"Introduction Amirah l’nochri (sometimes referred to as amirah l’akum ) is the Rabbinic prohibition to benefit from the melachah of a non-Jew, and to tell a non-Jew to do a melachah . All acts that are prohibited on Shabbos are included in the prohi- bition, except in circumstances that Chazal exempted, as we will discuss in detail. Reasons for the Prohibition There are several possible reasons why Chazal deemed it necessary to enact this prohibition: 1. The Rambam writes that Chazal were concerned that Shabbos obser- vance would become slack if Jews were permitted to instruct non-Jews to work for them, and that Jews themselves would end up transgressing Shabbos. 2323_. Rashi writes that the non-Jews would appear like agents of the Jews when transgressing Shabbos, and also that instructing a non-Jew to do melachah is included in the prohibition of daber davar (speaking about forbidden melachah ) — see Day___. 2324 However, as we have mentioned before, Chazal ’s wisdom is beyond our understanding, and their decrees are binding even if we do not know the precise reason for them, and even if the reason they applied to the decree is not relevant. When It Applies Amirah l’nochri applies on Shabbos, Yom Tov, and even Chol HaMoed — that is, one is forbidden to instruct to a non-Jew to do any melachah that a Jew is forbidden to do on Chol HaMoed. (We will elaborate on this at a later point.) It is worth noting that the prohibition against telling a non-Jew to do some- thing that is prohibited for a Jew applies to all prohibitions, not just those that apply to Shabbos. For example, one may not tell a non-Jew to muzzle an animal while it is plowing or threshing. 2325 Potential Loss As with other prohibitions, one must be steadfast in his faith in Hashem, and be prepared to lose all of his possessions in order to avoid a prohibition. This also applies to Rabbinic prohibitions. That said, Chazal waived the prohibition in certain cases of potential loss (see Day___ for details). • One may not instruct a non-Jew to open his store on Shabbos, even though keeping the store closed will cause a great loss.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2323.

382,10/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: INSTRUCTING AND BENEFITING,"The two aspects of amirah l’nochri are the prohibition to instruct a non-Jew to do something that is prohibited on Shabbos, and the prohibition to benefit from such an action. Instructing a Non-Jew to Do a Melachah One may not tell a non-Jew to do any Torah or Rabbinic prohibition that applies to Shabbos, Yom Tov, or Chol HaMoed, respectively. 2326 • One may not instruct a non-Jew to cook on Shabbos. • One may not instruct a non-Jew to build a house on Yom Tov. • One may not instruct a non-Jew to write a letter on Chol HaMoed when it would be forbidden for a Jew to do so. It is worth noting that certain leniencies exist regarding doing melachah on Chol HaMoed. It is not relevant whether the non-Jew was instructed before Shabbos or on Shabbos — both are prohibited. 2327 We will discuss limited cases in which one may hint to a non-Jew to do certain melachos . BENEFITING FROM A MELACHAH If one did tell a non-Jew to do a melachah (even in error), and he did it, the Jew may not benefit from it. 2328 In addition, even after Shabbos has departed, one must wait for the amount of time that it would have taken to perform that melachah before benefiting from it. If it would be impossible to do the melachah after Shabbos, one may never benefit from the act. • If one (mistakenly or not) instructed a non-Jew to boil up hot water, he may not use that hot water on Shabbos. He may only use that hot water after the time that it would take to boil after Shabbos. • If one (mistakenly or not) instructed a non-Jew to take a picture on Shabbos, he may never benefit from the picture, as it is impossible for a Shabbos picture to be taken after Shabbos. 2329 The Reason for the Penalty of Waiting Until After Shabbos The penalty of waiting for the amount of time that it would take to accom- plish the melachah after Shabbos has ended was enacted for two reasons. First, Chazal wished to ensure that one would not benefit in any way from melachah that was done for him on Shabbos. Second, Chazal were concerned that one would come to ask a non-Jew on Shabbos to do melachah for after Shabbos. 2330",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2326. Mishnah Berurah  243:5.

383,11/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: BENEFITING,"We have learned that one may not benefit from a non-Jew’s forbidden act, even if he did not instruct the non-Jew to do it — as long as it was done for the benefit of the Jew, it is forbidden. NOT CONSIDERED BENEFIT There is, however, a distinction between benefits that are creative and pro- ductive and that introduce active positive benefits, and benefits that are much more minor and passive, such as the removal of something, or merely adding to an existing situation. Some leniencies apply to such minor benefits, although one still may not ask a non-Jew to do the melachah . 2331 It is important to note that the distinction between benefits that are due to an active, created benefit versus those that are from a removal of something only applies in cases where a non-Jew has already done the melachah , post facto . But one may not ask a non-Jew to do so. • One is not allowed to ask a non-Jew to turn off the lights so that he may sleep. If one did, thereby transgressing the prohibition of amirah l’nochri , and the non-Jew did so, he need not leave the room. This is because the removal of light is not considered a Halachic benefit that created or produced darkness, but rather the removal of light. However, if one asked the non-Jew to turn on the light, he may not use the room where the light is since that is a creative and active benefit. 2332 • If the non-Jew turned off a light without being asked — even if it was for the benefit of the Jew — one need not leave the room. ADDITIONAL BENEFIT Similarly, if the benefit was already present in some lesser fashion, and the act performed by the non-Jew simply added to it, this is also not Halachically considered benefiting. However, benefiting from an act that changes the situa- tion and allows a benefit that was not available before the act was done is pro- hibited. Again, this does not permit one to ask a non-Jew to perform an act that one would be permitted to benefit from — one may only benefit post-facto . 2333 Furthermore, if the original situation is removed and now all that is left is the result of the act of the non-Jew, one cannot get a direct and specific benefit from it — but one need only leave the room if he instructed the non-Jew, but not if the non-Jew did so of his own voilition. • If one was eating in a dimly lit room, he may not ask a non-Jew to turn on more lights. If he did, thereby transgressing the prohibition of amirah l’nochri , and the non-Jew did so, or if the non-Jew did so on his own volition, he need not leave the room. He may not start reading a book that could not have been read by dim lighting, as that is a new benefit that emerged from the additional light. However, if the original lights go off and the only one that remains is the additional light that was turned on by the non-Jew, he may no longer get a direct specific benefit from it, but he need not leave the room unless the non-Jew only did so because he was instructed to.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2331.

384,12/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: HINTING,"We have discussed the prohibition of directly instructing a non-Jew to do something that is forbidden on Shabbos. We also distinguished between a di- rect tangible benefit (e.g., switching on the light) and a benefit that is indirect and intangible (e.g., switching off the light), when the melachah was already performed by the non-Jew ( post facto ). We also saw that one need not leave the room ( post facto ) in a case where the benefit had already been present in a lesser fashion and the new benefit is an addition (e.g., switching on more lights), unless the non-Jew was instructed. Other leniencies apply as well to these two kinds of benefiting that are not considered Halachically real (intangible benefit and additional benefit), as we will now begin to discuss. Hinting Although directly asking a non-Jew to do a melachah on Shabbos is always forbidden, hinting to a non-Jew is permitted under certain circumstances. How- ever, even in these limited cases, it is never permitted for a direct tangible benefit — only for an indirect, intangible benefit____ or for a benefit that had already been available in a lesser fashion. 2335 There are two categories of hints: A Hint That Implies a Command One is only permitted to say a hint that implies a command or request to a non-Jew before Shabbos. It is prohibited to do so on Shabbos. 2336 • During the week, one may say to a non-Jew, “Why didn’t you turn off the light when you left last Friday night?” In that way, the non-Jew will understand that he should turn off the light next Shabbos. However, on Shabbos, one may not say, “Why didn’t you switch off the light last week?” Doing so is a hint that implies a command to turn off the lights now, which is forbidden to do on Shabbos. 2337 A Hint That Is Casual One is permitted to make a casual hint, such as part of a story or coming up in conversation, even on Shabbos. 2338 • Even on Shabbos, one may say to a non-Jew, “It is so bright in here that I am having trouble falling asleep.” This is permitted because there is no reference of instruction to the non-Jew, just a statement of fact. 2339 It is worth pointing out that in both cases, the benefit is indirect and intan- gible (i.e., the removal of light). If the benefit is direct and tangible (e.g., adding light in a place that was dark), one may not benefit from it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2334. Mishnah Berurah  307:11.

385,13/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF THE  HALACHOS OF HINTING,"We will now demonstrate the practical application of the halachos of hint- ing discussed so far, using an air conditioner, fan, or heater as an example. We will also discuss the difference between such appliances and a car alarm that goes off. Turning It On The creation of cold or hot air is a direct and tangible benefit. One may not ask or hint to a non-Jew to turn on such a device, and one may not benefit from the action of a non-Jew if he did so for a Jew’s benefit (even without a Jew asking). Turning It Off The removal of cold or hot air is an indirect, intangible benefit. One may not ask a non-Jew to turn off the device outright. However, during the week, one may hint to a non-Jew in a way that implies a request (so that the non-Jew will turn off the device the following Shabbos). On Shabbos, one may only hint by stating facts. • Example of a hint that is permitted during the week: “Why didn’t you turn the air conditioner off last Shabbos?” • Example of a hint that is permitted on Shabbos: “It’s too cold.” Car Alarms Switching off a car alarm is not considered a Halachic benefit (as it is the removal of something). One may not ask a non-Jew to turn off the device out- right. However, if it is disturbing the peace and the neighbors will not be able to sleep, one may even be permitted to tell a non-Jew directly. 2340 One should consult a Rav . In any case, during the week, one may hint to a non-Jew in a way that implies a request (so that the non-Jew will turn off the alarm if it is triggered the following Shabbos). On Shabbos, one may only hint by stating facts. • Example of a hint that is permitted during the week: “Why didn’t you turn the alarm off last Shabbos?” • Example of a hint that is permitted on Shabbos: “The alarm is disturbing people.” Excessive Cold We have seen that when one is ill (to the point that he needs to rest), he may ask a non-Jew to do a melachah without hinting (see Day___). Chazal , in their wisdom, equated a person who is very cold to one who is sick. In such a case, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on a heater straight-out. 2341 This leniency applies to children and the elderly more often than to other people, as they are more affected by the cold.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2340.

386,14/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: HOUSEHOLD  AND CONTRACTED HELP,"We are discussing the prohibition of benefiting from a non-Jew’s melachah , and the prohibition to instruct a non-Jew to do melachah . We saw that one is allowed to hint under the parameters discussed above (in Days___—351). Household and Contracted Help This presents a problem in places where Jews employ non-Jewish maids, gardeners, and the like. One may not allow a non-Jew to do a melachah for a Jew. This is true even if one is not particular that the melachah is performed on Shabbos, and even if the non-Jew is not being paid per day or per job. 2342 • One may not allow one’s cleaning lady to do laundry or turn on lights on Shabbos, as this would involve a number of different melachos that would benefit the Jew. (We will discuss jobs that could be done without her doing an actual melachah in Day___.) • One may not allow his gardener to water the garden or mow the lawn on Shabbos, as these would involve a number of different melachos that would benefit the Jew. • One may not allow a plumber or electrician to fix a problem on Shab- bos (even if he was supposed to arrive before Shabbos). 2343 However, in cases of great need, such as lacking hot food for Shabbos or unsan- itary conditions, there may be room for leniency, 2344 and a Rav should be consulted. If the non-Jewish maid chooses to do the melachah on Shabbos because she wants to give herself free time during the week, it may be permitted. However, even then, she should do it in her own room, not on the property of the Jew. But the Jew may not instruct her to do so — it must be the non-Jew’s decision alone. 2345 • A non-Jewish maid may decide to do the laundry of her employer in her own room. We will discuss the permissibility of allowing a non-Jew to perform an action that does not include a melachah even though the non-Jew will almost certainly choose to do a melachah while doing so, as that is the normal way that it is done (see Day___).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2342.

387,15/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: ON THE NON-JEW’S PROPERTY OR  FOR THE NON-JEW’S BENEFIT,"We have seen that one may not allow a non-Jew to perform a melachah for a Jew, even if he is employed for the month and even if he is being paid by the job, unless he wants to do it to free up his weekday and does so on his own property. We will now discuss situations in which the non-Jew does the melachah on his own property and/or for his own benefit. The Non-Jew’s Property One may allow (or cause) a non-Jew to do a melachah that benefits a Jew on the non-Jew’s property, under the following conditions. First, the Jew must not be particular that the melachah be done on Shabbos. Included in this stipulation is allowing time for the melachah to be performed during the week. Second, it must not be obvious that the action is being done for the Jew. Third, the item that the melachah is being done to must be removed from the Jew’s home before Shabbos. 2346 • One may give in a suit to a non-Jewish dry cleaner before Shabbos even though he may do the melachah of cleaning it on Shabbos. This is be- cause the dry cleaner store is not on the property of the Jew. This is only permitted if the Jew did not specify that he wants the suit to be cleaned on Shabbos, and he left sufficient time for it to be done during the weekday. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE NON-JEW If a non-Jew does a melachah for himself while on a Jew’s property, it is generally forbidden for the Jew to benefit from it, unless it is obvious to all that he is doing it for himself. 2347 • One may not allow his maid to cook in his house on Shabbos, as it is not obvious that she is doing it for herself. But she may cook for herself in her own quarters.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2346. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  252:4;  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  30:29.

388,16/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: HOTEL KEY CARDS  AND RESIDENT COMPLEXES,"We have seen that a non-Jew may not do a melachah for a Jew even if he is employed for the month and even if he is being paid by the job, unless it is for the non-Jew’s benefit, in his own time, and on his own property. This affects some of the day-to-day situations that we encounter. Hotel Key Cards Today, most hotels give clients a card that activates the door to their room. No heat is generated as a result of the activation (the light that may appear is LED), and so, according to most Poskim , in most cases there is no Torah prohi- bition. However, since the card makes an active change in the functionality of the door/electric current, it is still a Rabbinic prohibition. Therefore, one may not use a hotel key card on Shabbos. One must organize a better way to get into his room before Shabbos. If he did not, these are the options: • One can place a chocolate or a drink in the room, and tell the non-Jew that there is a gift for him in the room. In that way, he will enter for his own benefit. • It could be argued that the unlocking of a door is not a direct benefit, but rather, the removal of an obstacle or issue, similar to turning off a light. Therefore, one can indirectly hint to the non-Jew on Shabbos, saying, “I can’t open the door” or “The door is closed.” 2348 The hint must be a statement of fact, and cannot imply a request to the non-Jew. Resident Complexes In many places, it is common to hire non-Jewish guards to protect shuls or residential complexes. When the non-Jewish guard sees the Jew approaching, he presses a button to open the gate, effectively doing a melachah on behalf of the Jew, which is generally forbidden. However, if the Jew could have realistically opened the gate himself in a permitted way (such as using a normal key for a manual pedestrian gate), he is permitted to benefit from the non-Jew’s melachah , as it is not Halachically considered benefiting. We will learn more about this in Day___. It is worth recalling that in many cases, passing through a motion sensor causes an electric current, which is prohibited. In most cases, however, the light is LED, which may allow for a leniency: a. If one is passing through for a mitzvah or a great need, one can walk normally, for example, when walking to shul, to a Shabbos meal, to his house. b. If one is not passing through for a mitzvah or a great need, he must jump____ or walk through sideways or backwards. 2350 One should preferably avoid all these problems, especially on a regular basis, by using the pedestrian gate. NOTE: If the sensor is not LED, one may not rely on the above.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2348.

389,17/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  AFTER CANDLE-LIGHTING,"We will now interrupt our discussion of amirah l’nochri to discuss an im- portant leniency. If there is a need (as defined below), one may ask a non-Jew to do melachah until nightfall (three stars). 2351 That is, even after one has lit Shabbos candles, and even after shkiyah (sunset), there is a window in which to apply this leniency. We have mentioned previously that in Eretz Yisrael, this window is the duration of fifteen to twenty minutes after sunset, but the length of this period is dependent on both the location and the season. In New York, this period may be up to forty minutes after sunset. 2352 One must determine the exact time that this window applies in the place where he lives and the time of year. Obviously, this leniency also applies before sunset. DEFINING ""NECESSARY"" • For a mitzvah • If a woman forgot to light candles and sunset has just passed, she can and must ask a non-Jew to light candles for her if nightfall (three stars) has not yet arrived. She does not recite a brachah on the light- ing. 2353 • If a shul’s Sefer Torah was inadvertently left in a different location, one may ask a non-Jew during this period to bring it to the shul, even if he must bring it through a reshus harabim . • Necessary for Shabbos • During this period, one may ask a non-Jew to sew up a hole in a Shabbos garment or fix a pipe that is leaking. • If one forgot to switch on the hot plate, he may ask a non-Jew to turn it on during this period. 2354 If the food was not yet cooked, there may be a problem of bishulakum (the Rabbinic prohibition of eating food cooked by a non-Jew). (See also Day___.) • Disturbing over Shabbos • If one arrived at shul for Minchah and realized that he forgot to light a yahrtzeit candle, he may ask a non-Jew to light one during this period____ if not having it lit will disturb him over Shabbos. • If laundry is wet and will smell over Shabbos, one may ask a non-Jew during this period to hang it up. (One may not ask the non-Jew to turn on a dryer.) Early Shabbos Strictly speaking, the prohibition of doing melachah begins a few minutes before sunset. However, as we have discussed, there is a great mitzvah to usher Shabbos in earlier. 2356 If one has done so, although he may not do melachah him- self, the above leniency still applies, and he may ask a non-Jew to do melachah , if necessary, during this time. 2357 Moreover, one may even tell another Jew who has not yet accepted Shabbos to do melachah for him. 2358 • If one lit candles earlier than candle-lighting time, he may not do any melachah . However, he may still instruct the cleaning lady to mop the floor, ensuring that the house is clean for Shabbos. He can even tell another Jew who has not yet accepted Shabbos to do so.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2351. Eiruvin  32b;  Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  342:1.

390,18/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: SUDDEN LOSS,"In general, one may not transgress any prohibition merely to save his pos- sessions. However, there are several allowances that Chazal made (through the use of non-Jews) in cases of sudden potential loss. • As we have discussed in detail (in Day___), one may show a non-Jew a fire and hint to him in a way that implies a command, such as, “Who- ever puts out the fire or calls the fire department will be rewarded.” 2359 Although one may generally not give a hint that implies a command on Shabbos (only during the week), Chazal allowed it in this instance. 2360 Some Poskim apply this halachah to the case of a power outage or a disconnected plug on a very hot day, which puts valuable frozen food at risk of going bad. 2361 These Poskim rule that one may hint to a non-Jew in a way that implies a command: “Whoever reconnects the refrigerator or freezer will be rewarded.” Although one may generally not give a hint that implies a command on Shabbos (only during the week), Chazal allowed it in this instance. 2362 Note that there must be a real risk of loss — if this happens on Shabbos afternoon and there is no chance of any spoilage (especially if the freezer door remains closed), one may not rely on this leniency. • If a Jew’s possessions are at risk of loss or damage, and a non-Jew comes to save them on his own accord, the Jew need not protest. 2363 • If a fire breaks out in a non-Jew’s property, one may tell him about it, even if by doing so he will prevent the fire from spreading to his own property. 2364 • One may explicitly ask a non-Jew to save holy articles such as tefillin, sefarim , and mezuzos from being stolen or damaged (see also Day___). 2365",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2359.

391,19/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: PROTESTING,"We have discussed the prohibition to instruct a non-Jew to do melachah , and the prohibition to benefit from melachah that a non-Jew does on a Jew’s behalf. In certain cases of direct and tangible benefit, one must protest if a non-Jew wishes to do a melachah (even on his own accord). On the Jew’s Property If a non-Jew comes to do a melachah that has direct and tangible benefits for a Jew in a Jew’s house, the Jew is required to object, even if he does not plan to benefit from it. 2366 • If one is in the dark, and the cleaning lady comes to turn on the light, he must tell her not to do so. The same applies when it is cold and the cleaning lady comes to turn on the heat (unless it is very cold or children are present). With the Jew’s Possessions If the objects or implements used for the melachah belong to the Jew, he must stop a non-Jew from using the objects, even if the melachah will not take place on the Jew’s property. 2367 • If one is walking on the street in the dark, and a maid arrives with his flashlight to light up the way, he must tell her not to use it. If the Non-Jew Persists If the non-Jew does not listen to the protests and does the melachah anyway, one is permitted to benefit from the melachah . 2368 However, if the non-Jew did the melachah in the house of the Jew (after being told not to do so), he should be warned that such an act is grounds for not being allowed in the house. 2369 Not Required to Protest As we have seen in the past, when any advantage from a melachah is not considered a Halachic benefit (as defined in Day___), one also need not object if a non-Jew would do it on his own accord. 2370 • If one wishes to sleep in a room where the light is on, and a non-Jew is going to turn it off on his own accord, one need not protest. • If a light that is sufficient for basic needs is on, one may allow a non-Jew to turn on more lights on his own accord, as this is not considered a Halachic benefit. 2371 However, if the original lights go off and the only one that remains is the additional light that was turned on by the non- Jew, he may no longer benefit from it. A Word of Caution Regarding This Leniency We have said that indirect hinting (such as stating facts, as we defined in Day___) is permitted for an indirect and Halachically intangible or additional benefit (as defined in Day___), and one need not object when a non-Jew does it for a Jew’s benefit. However, it is worth noting that this ruling is not unani- mous. 2372 Some Poskim are stringent, and do not allow hinting, and say that one must certainly object. Therefore, in the examples above, there is room to be stringent and object even when a non-Jew turns off lights or turns on additional light, and certainly not to hint to the non-Jew to do so. Furthermore, hinting in a factual manner to allow the permissible benefits to be done for a Jew should not be done on a regular basis.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2366.

392,20/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: PROTESTING,"We will now discuss the halachah regarding a melachah that a non-Jew did for a Jew’s benefit, in a case where the Jew would have been required to protest and did not — that is, a case of Halachic benefit (as defined in Day___ as a cre- ative and active gain). It is not relevant whether the Jew had the opportunity to protest, or whether the Jew even knew that the melachah was being performed. A Torah Prohibition Chazal were particularly strict regarding Torah-prohibited acts. 2373 No Jew may benefit from any melachah that was done by a non-Jew for a Jew, 2374 even if the Jew did not ask or hint for it. Benefiting from the melachah is only permitted after waiting the amount of time that it would take to produce that benefit after Shabbos. 2375 In some cases, the object produced by the non-Jew is also muktzeh . 2376 • If a non-Jew picked an apple for a Jew (even if the Jew did not ask or hint for it), the apple may not be eaten until the amount of time that it would take to pick the apple after Shabbos has passed. The apple is also muktzeh , as it was still attached to the tree when Shabbos came in. • If a non-Jew sewed a garment for a Jew (even if the Jew did not ask or hint for it), the garment may not be worn until the amount of time that it would take to sew the garment after Shabbos has passed. A Rabbinic Prohibition If the melachah done was a Rabbinic prohibition, only the Jew for whom the melachah was performed needs to wait for the amount of time that it would have taken to do the melachah after Shabbos. However, other Jews may benefit from the melachah on Shabbos itself. 2377 • If a non-Jew tied a Rabbinically prohibited knot for Yaakov, Yaakov must wait the amount of time that it would take to tie such a knot after Shabbos before benefiting from it. However, Yaakov’s friend Yosef may benefit from it on Shabbos. In Public If a non-Jew publicly did a melachah that is obviously for a Jew on Shabbos, the Jew may never benefit from that melachah . 2378 However, if there is a great need, one should consult a Rav , as there may be leniencies. 2379 • If non-Jews built an extension for Avraham’s house on Shabbos, Avra- ham may never benefit from it. However, if there is a great need for the extension, Avraham should consult a Rav to see if there is an applicable leniency. A HALACHICALLY INTANGIBLE BENEFIT As we stated at the beginning of this section, the above relates to Halachic benefits (as defined in Day___). In cases in which Halachah does not consider it a benefit — such as a passive benefit or the removal of something, one need not wait at all before benefiting from the act. However, the optional stringency that we mentioned above (at the end of Day___) applies here, and it is praiseworthy to refrain from benefiting from any melachah . • If a non-Jew climbed a tree to retrieve a ball, one may use the ball. Re- moving the ball from the tree was merely removing an obstacle to using the ball, and the act of climbing the tree (a Rabbinic prohibition) is not Halachically relevant to the ball. However, there is room to be stringent and avoid using the ball.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2373. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  515:1. This is in order that one would not benefit from  melachos  done for a Jew, and to prevent Jews from instructing non-Jews to do  melachah  on Shabbos  in order to benefit after Shabbos.

393,21/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  JEWS WHO ARE NOT OBSERVANT,"We have been discussing benefiting from a non-Jew’s melachah . Jews Who Are Not Observant What if a Jew who deliberately does not keep Shabbos does melachah on one’s behalf? The halachah is that all Jews may benefit from the melachah after Shabbos has ended, but only after waiting the amount of time that was gained by doing it on Shabbos. 2380 • If a non-Jew cooks peas or carrots (i.e., in a way that bishul akum is not transgressed) on Shabbos for a Jew, one must wait for the amount of time that it would have taken to cook them after Shabbos. The same applies if a Jew who deliberately does not keep Shabbos cooked it. • If a nonobservant Jewish bus driver starts his rounds on Shabbos, one should ideally not use the bus immediately after Shabbos. 2381 Rather, he should wait for the amount of time that it would take him to get to the stop from his starting point. However, if that is not possible, he may be lenient. 2382 By Mistake Some nonobservant Jews have absolutely no knowledge of the concept or halachos of Shabbos. If a melachah was done by a Jew unknowingly or uninten- tionally, not for the sake of another Jew, although the one who did the melachah must wait until after Shabbos before benefiting, everyone else may benefit from it on Shabbos, if necessary. 2383 If it was done for another Jew, the waiting period after Shabbos is still required. Before applying this halachah, one should consult a Rav (see Days__—86 for an in-depth discussion on this topic).",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2380.

394,22/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: DELIVERIES,"We have seen that one may not benefit from any melachah done for him by a non-Jew. A common situation in which this applies is receiving deliveries on Shabbos. Deliveries by a Non-Jew If a parcel or letter arrives, one may tell the non-Jewish courier to put it down, but he should not accept it from him with his hand. This is only if the Jew did not specify that it should be delivered on Shabbos. If one did specify that it should be delivered on Shabbos, he must wait the time that it would take to deliver the parcel after Shabbos before benefiting, as instructing a non-Jew to do a melachah on Shabbos is forbidden. 2384 • If one’s delayed luggage is delivered by the airline on Shabbos, he may tell the courier to drop it in a particular place, but he should not take it by hand from him. If he was particular that it be delivered on Shabbos, he must not open the luggage until the amount of time that it would have taken to deliver the luggage after Shabbos. 2385 It is worth noting that some Poskim are more stringent, and rule that even if the Jew did not request that the parcel arrive on Shabbos, if it arrives through the performance of Torah melachos (such as driving a car, which involves maavir (lighting a fire]), one must wait until the time that it would have taken to deliver the parcel after Shabbos before benefiting from the package. 2386 The parcel is also muktzeh . According to them, in the less common case where the only pro- hibition transgressed is somehow only Rabbinic (such as a delivery by bicycle from an area inside the city that is a karmelis , without an eiruv ), those for whom the delivery is not intended may benefit from the delivery immediately, though the one for whom the delivery was intended must wait as above. 2387 Deliveries by a Jew We noted that if a Jew intentionally and knowingly does a melachah for a Jew, one may not benefit from it on Shabbos, 2388 and the Poskim say that one should be stringent and wait for the time that it took to do the melachah , if possible. 2389 • If a nonobservant visitor deliberately drives in for a meal knowing that it is forbidden to do so on Shabbos, and brings a gift, one should be stringent and wait for the amount of time that it would take him to bring it after Shabbos before opening it, if possible. We also saw that if a Jew did a melachah unintentionally or unknowingly, one may benefit from it on Shabbos, if necessary. 2390 However, if the prohibition transgressed was Rabbinic and did not have a direct impact on the item, one may benefit from it, even if it is not necessary. 2391 This leniency may apply to deliveries. 2392 • If a Jew did not know that carrying in a karmelis is forbidden, one may still benefit from the gift on Shabbos, if necessary, as the prohibition involved was Rabbinic and was just transporting the gift, and not cre- ating the gift.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2384.

395,23/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: IF THE ACT  COULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED  WITHOUT THE MELACHAH,"We touched on the following subject previously, and we will now clarify it further. There is a dispute among the commentators whether one is permitted to benefit from the melachah of a non-Jew in a case where the Jew himself could have accomplished the end result in a different, permissible way, without the melachah of the non-Jew. 2393 The Halachah The Mishnah Berurah seems to conclude that if it was a Torah prohibition that was performed, one should ideally not benefit from it on Shabbos. 2394 How- ever, one may benefit immediately after Shabbos, without waiting the amount of time it would have taken for the melachah to be accomplished. 2395 If it was a Rabbinic prohibition, though, one may benefit from it on Shabbos if it is needed for the sake of Shabbos. 2396 Note that there may be leniencies even when the non-Jew did a Torah pro- hibition. In such cases, one should consult a Rav . 2397 • If non-Jews transported drinks for a kiddush using a car (which involves the melachah of maavir [lighting a fire]), one generally would have to wait the amount of time that it would have taken to transport the drinks after Shabbos. However, if one could have gone to the place where the drinks were without any need for a melachah , he need not wait any additional time after Shabbos. In cases of great need (such as on a hot day, and the community is waiting to drink), there is room to be lenient, and one should consult a Rav . 2398 • If the non-Jew carried the drinks in a karmelis where there is no eiruv , it constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. In such a case, one may benefit from the drinks on Shabbos if he really needs them. Moreover, in cases of great urgency, one can even ask the non-Jew to bring them, though it is better to avoid doing so. 2399",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2393.

396,24/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: MELACHAH FOR  THE NON JEW'S BENEFIT,"We are currently discussing several cases relating to the prohibition to ben- efit from a melachah done by a non-Jew. Melachah Done by a Non-Jew for Himself We said that one is prohibited to benefit from a melachah that a non-Jew does for a Jew. What is the halachah when the non-Jew did the melachah for his own benefit? Chazal were concerned that were they to allow a blanket leniency in this case, the non-Jew would regularly do melachah for the Jew’s benefit. 2400 There- fore, they only allowed it in a case where the non-Jew would not need to do more melachah in order to include the Jew’s benefit. However, if the non-Jew would be required to add to his act in order to provide enough benefit for the Jew, Chazal prohibited benefiting from the non-Jew’s act if he knows the Jew. 2401 If the Benefit Is Sufficient for Both • If a non-Jew switches on the light for himself on Shabbos, a Jew may benefit, even if the non-Jew knows him. This is because one flick of the light switch is enough for everyone present to gain from it, and the non-Jew would never need to do more melachos because of Jews who are present. The same applies to devices such as air conditioners or heaters, where there is no need to do more melachah for the extra Jews that are present. • If a non-Jew sets up a rudimentary bridge for himself on Shabbos, a Jew may use it, even if the non-Jew knows him. This is because his bridge is sufficient for anybody who wishes to walk across it, without requiring any further melachos from the non-Jew. If the Benefit Is Insufficient Without Doing More Melachah • If a non-Jew who knows the Jew boiled water or squeezed orange juice for himself, the Jew may not benefit from it. This is because both of them cannot drink the same water or juice, and it is necessary to make more if anyone else is to benefit from it. 2402 If the Non-Jew Does Not Know the Jew We have noted that the prohibition of gaining when a non-Jew does melachah for himself only applies when the non-Jew knows the Jew, and could reasonably assume that the Jew could benefit. 2403 However, if the non-Jew does not know the Jew, and the Jew is not visibly present at the time of the melachah , there is no likelihood of the non-Jew ever doing more melachah with the Jew in mind, and one may benefit from the non-Jew’s melachah . 2404 • If a non-Jew boiled water for himself, and he had absolutely no knowl- edge that a Jew would be around to benefit from it, a Jew may benefit from it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2400.

397,25/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: MELACHAH FOR  THE NON JEW'S BENEFIT CONTINUED,"We have seen that one may not benefit from a non-Jew when he does a melachah for himself (or other non-Jews) if he would need to do more because a Jew is benefiting. If a non-Jew does melachah and both non-Jews and Jews are there to benefit, the halachah is as follows. 2405 It is Unclear Whom He Did It For If it is not obvious whom the non-Jew had in mind when he performed the melachah , the halachah depends on who is present. If the majority of the people benefiting are non-Jews, a Jew is permitted to benefit as well. However, if fifty percent or more of the people present are Jews, a Jew may not benefit from the melachah . • If one is in a room where the majority are non-Jews, and a non-Jew ran- domly turns on the light and leaves, one may benefit from the light. How- ever, if at least half of the people present are Jews, he may not benefit. If It Is Clear Whom He Did It For If it is obvious that the non-Jew did the melachah for the non-Jews present, a Jew may benefit even if Jews are the majority present. 2406 On the other hand, if it is obvious that he did it for a Jew, a Jew may not benefit even if the majority present are non-Jews. • If a non-Jew turned on the light so that he could read a book, a Jew may benefit from the light. However, if the non-Jew saw a Jew struggling to read and only then turned on the light, a Jew may not benefit from the light. Hotels If one is staying in a hotel where most of the residents are not Jewish, and non-Jewish workers fill up the urn every day, it is debatable whether a Jew can use that water. Although the majority of the clients are not Jewish, the Jew has paid the hotel to serve him, and whatever they do is also clearly for the Jewish clients. On the other hand, they would have to do it even if Jews were not pres- ent. The halachah is that it is best not to use the water. However, one may be lenient if necessary. 2407",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2405. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  276:2.

398,26/08/2026,"AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: MELACHAH FOR  THE NON-JEWS BENEFITS, CONTINUED","We are discussing the prohibition to benefit when a non-Jew did melachah for Jews, as well as the permissibility of benefiting when the non-Jew clearly did melachah for non-Jews. We said that when it is not clear for whom the non-Jew did the melachah , a Jew may benefit if the majority of people pres- ent were non-Jews. We will now discuss a few more practical applications of these halachos. Elevators One should not go into an elevator even when a non-Jew is going to the same floor and presses the buttons. There are a few reasons for this. First, some elevators use more electricity if there is greater weight inside. Second, sometimes there is a motion or weight detector that causes a light to go on as one enters. Third, riding an elevator may be included in the Rabbinic prohibition of zilzul Shabbos (showing disrespect for Shabbos by doing weekday acts). Finally, it is almost always maris ayin (the prohibition to do something that looks like it is forbidden), as an onlooker may think that it is permitted outright. 2408 (See Day___ for more discussion on elevators, including Shabbos elevators.) That said, there may be leniencies to use a non-Jew in cases of necessity, such if a sick person needs to get up to a different floor. One should consult a Rav in these cases. Light Switches If a non-Jew switches on the lights of a garage or stairwell for himself, a Jew may benefit from the light. But a Jew may not invite a non-Jew over with the knowledge that he will certainly switch on lights that are off in his presence. 2409 Fixing a Mistake If a non-Jew mistakenly switches off a Jew’s light, and then (without being asked) switches it back on, the Jew may benefit from the light. The non-Jew views his act as a means of fixing his own mistake, not as switching on a light for the Jew’s benefit. 2410 However, if the non-Jew was required to do the melachah before Shabbos yet forgot to do so, and does it on Shabbos instead, a Jew may not benefit from it. 2411 This is because the non-Jew is not restoring something, but rather, making something new. 2412 However, if one instructed the non-Jew not to do it, and he did it anyway, he may benefit (as discussed in Day___.) NOTE: If the one fixing his own mistake is a Jew who intentionally and know- ingly does not keep Shabbos, one may not benefit from his act on Shabbos — see Day___.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2408.

399,27/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: PSIK REISHA,"We have covered the basic halachos regarding instructing and benefiting from the melachah of non-Jews. We will now discuss a few leniencies. In general, one may not do an act that will inevitably result in a melachah on Shabbos. This is known as psik reisha (literally, cutting off the head — an act that inevitably results in death — see Day__). • Pouring water over grass or seeds constitutes the Torah prohibition of zore’a (planting). If one washes his hands over the grass in his own garden, it constitutes zore’a even though the act of turning on the water is a permitted act, as doing so will inevitably result in irrigation. 2413 Psik Reisha by a Non-Jew However, one may ask a non-Jew to do a psik reisha if necessary, 2414 as long as there is no direct benefit from the melachah that emerges. 2415 Practical Applications • If one forgot to remove or turn off a refrigerator light which turns on as one opens the door, and he needs food from the refrigerator, he may ask a non-Jew to open the refrigerator for him. This is because the act of opening a refrigerator door is not a melachah in its own right. Rather, it will inevitably result in the light turning on when doing so, from which there is no direct benefit (see Day___ regarding the Halachic status of electricity), and one may ask a non-Jew to do a permissible act that results in a melachah , if necessary. 2416 • If one needs hot water on Shabbos, he may ask a non-Jew to open the hot-water faucet, as long as the electric boiler is already on. This also applies to a solar heating system. This is because turning on hot water is not a melachah in its own right. Rather, it will inevitably cook the cold water that flows into the boiler afterwards (the melachah of bishul [cooking]), which is not a direct benefit that the Jew is interested in, and one may ask a non-Jew to do a permissible act that results in a melachah , if necessary. But if the hot water system is gas-based, where turning on the hot-water faucet will light a spark, one may not ask the non-Jew to do so. This is because the Jew’s request is actually to light up the fire that will cause the water to boil, and hot water that was just boiled is a direct benefit. 2417",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2413.

400,28/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: PASSIVE BENEFIT,"We have seen that one may not benefit from the melachah that a non-Jew does for the benefit of a Jew, until the amount of time that it would have taken to do it after Shabbos has passed. However, this only means that one may not actively use the item. One need not refrain from any automatic or passive benefit that arises from it. 2418 Note that refraining from such a benefit is praiseworthy. A passive benefit means that the Jew will do exactly what he would have if the non-Jew wouldn’t have done the melachah — as opposed to an active benefit, where he starts to do something new as a gain from the melachah . That said, bear in mind that this leniency only applies after it has happened ( post facto ). One must object if he sees a non-Jew about to do melachah for a Jew. Moreover, this leniency does not apply if one asked the non-Jew to do the melachah — it only applies if the non-Jew did it for a Jew on his own accord before he was able to object. If one did ask the non-Jew to do the melachah , he may not benefit, even passively, from the melachah . 2419 If a non-Jew seems likely to do even a passive melachah for a Jew’s benefit (and especially if the non-Jew has already done so), he should warn the non-Jew never to do melachah for Jews in the future (as mentioned in Day___). • If a non-Jew sees a Jew sitting in the dark and turns on the light for him, the Jew may not actively benefit. He may not read or examine something that he was not able to sufficiently see previously. However, Chazal did not force him to leave the room, as that is not a new benefit — rather it is an automatic, passive benefit. That said, it is praiseworthy for one not to benefit from it at all, by turning his face from it or going elsewhere. AN ADDED BENEFIT As we have said, there is no limitation on a benefit that already existed in a more passive form. Although one must protest, as above, he need not avoid benefiting from it after it was done. • If cooked food was already warm enough to be eaten, and a non-Jew warmed it up more for a Jew, he may eat it. Moreover, there is no need to refrain from eating it, as the benefit gained is not a real Halachic benefit, but rather an additional benefit to a state that already existed, 2420 and Chazal did not require one to avoid it.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2418.

401,29/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: TELLING A  NON-JEW TO TELL A NON-JEW,"Although telling a non-Jew to do melachah is forbidden on Shabbos, there is a debate regarding telling a non-Jew to tell another non-Jew to do a melachah . 2421 The Mishnah Berurah rules that in general, one may not rely on this leniency. 2422 However, in one specific type of case, he allows it: a potential case of great loss, where there is no tangible and direct active benefit. One should note that cases where this leniency applies are very rare, and one should consult a Rav before applying it. Practical Applications • If one forgot to turn on lights before Shabbos, he may not instruct his non-Jewish cleaning lady to tell another non-Jew to do so, as hav- ing lights on is a tangible and direct benefit. This remains true even if it will somehow cause him a great loss. However, if a pipe burst on Shabbos and threatens to flood the house, causing tremendous damage to his possessions, there is reason to allow him to instruct his cleaning lady to get a non-Jewish plumber to fix the pipe. This is because fixing a pipe and stopping a flood is an indirect benefit, representing a removal of a problem. As noted, one should consult a Rav beforehand. 2423 • If one inadvertently left a generator on before Shabbos, he may instruct a non-Jewish cleaning lady to tell her husband to switch it off, as keep- ing it running can potentially cause a great loss, and turning it off is an indirect benefit.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2421.

402,30/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: FOR A MITZVAH,"There is a debate among the early Sages regarding asking a non-Jew to do a melachah that is necessary in order to perform a mitzvah. Again, in most cases, one may not rely on this. 2424 However, the Poskim say that one may rely on this in cases where the mitzvah is affecting the community, 2425 or where there will otherwise be a major issue. A Rav should be consulted in each case to decide if this leniency applies. 2426 • If a neighborhood eiruv breaks on Shabbos, one may ask a non-Jew to fix it. He should attempt to get the non-Jew to avoid doing any Torah prohibitions, such as by tying any strings using an impermanent knot (which constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition). 2427 This is only allowed in order to avoid a situation in which people will inadvertently carry on Shabbos. • If the identity tag for a newborn child was not prepared before Shab- bos, one may tell a non-Jew to write it. This is because maintaining the identity of a hardly identifiable newborn baby is crucial. 2428 • If the air conditioner is making the shul too cold or the lights have gone out in a way that the community can no longer daven or hear the Torah being read in the shul, one may instruct a non-Jew to fix the issue. 2429 Bris Milah The one Torah mitzvah to which this leniency was applied in the Gemara (according to some commentators) is bris milah. The Torah states that a baby must have his bris milah on the eighth day of his life, even if it falls on Shabbos. This permits the mohel to cut off the baby’s foreskin on Shabbos even though it normally constitutes the melachah of shochet (slaughtering). However, only the actual bris is permitted on Shabbos, and not anything else that is preparation for the bris, such as sharpening the knife or transporting it in a place where carrying is prohibited (a reshus harabim or a karmelis without an eiruv ). These must be done before Shabbos. If one inadvertently neglected to do so, the Mishnah Berurah allows asking a non-Jew to sharpen or transport the knife where there is no eiruv , if there is no other option. 2430 That said, if there is a different option, one must avoid this. For instance, if there is another mohel who stores his knife in that location, one must use it instead of his own knife if it will be as efficient. 2431",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2424.

403,31/08/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  MOVING MUKTZEH ITEMS,"Different rules apply to the respective categories of muktzeh regarding ask- ing a non-Jew to move them. (See the halachos of muktzeh , as indicated in each section below, for more details of each category listed here.) Kli SheMelachto L’Issur A kli shemelachto l’issur is an item whose primary use is forbidden on Shab- bos, but has other, secondary uses that are permissible. Such an item may be moved by a Jew, either for a permissible use or for the space that it occupies (see Days___—311 for more details). As it is theoretically possible for a Jew to move such an item, one may ask a non-Jew to do so, 2432 even to save the muktzeh item from being damaged or stolen. 2433 • One may ask a non-Jew to move a hammer out of the rain, even if he simply wants it not to get damaged. 2434 • Many toys fall into this category. One may ask a non-Jew to move such a toy. Muktzeh Machmas Chisaron Kis and Muktzeh Machmas Gufo An item is muktzeh machmas chisaron kis if it the owner is afraid that it may break or be misused (see Days___—318 for more details). An item is muktzeh machmas gufo if it has no intrinsic use at all (see Days___—323 for more details). Items in these two categories may only be moved by a Jew in an abnormal way (as discussed in Day___). The permissibility of having a non-Jew move an item in one of these two categories is more limited. 2435 One may only ask a non-Jew to move such an item in order to use it for a permitted use or for the space that it occupies. 2436 However, in rare cases, one may even ask a non-Jew to move it in order to prevent a major loss. (A Rav should be consulted.) 2437 • One may not randomly ask a non-Jew to move a passport. However, if it is in the way, he may ask a non-Jew to move it. • One may not randomly ask a non-Jew to move a stone. However, if he wishes to use the stone as a paperweight, he may ask the non-Jew to move it. • One may ask a non-Jew to move a smartphone out of the rain if the data that is on it is critical to him. Muktzeh Machmas Issur An item falls under the category of muktzeh machmas issur if moving it will cause a Shabbos transgression. Obviously, a Jew may not move such an item even after it will no longer cause a transgression (see Day___ for more details). There is much discussion about whether the above leniency regarding asking a non-Jew to move a muktzeh item applies to this category. One should consult a Rav before doing so. 2438 Nevertheless, one is allowed to ask a non-Jew to move such an item for the sake of performing a mitzvah. 2439 • There is much discussion regarding whether one may ask a non-Jew to move a candle if he needs the light elsewhere or if the candle is bother- ing him. A Rav should be consulted before doing so. • If the lights in the shul go out, and there are candles lit nearby, one may ask a non-Jew to bring them into the shul so that there is light.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2432.

404,01/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: DOUBLE  D’RABBANAN IN CASES OF NEED,"The following leniency is known as shvus d’shvus b’makom tzorech (a Rab- binic prohibition on a Rabbinic prohibition in a case of need). When the Shabbos prohibition in question is both Rabbinic (not a Torah prohibition), and is being done by a non-Jew (which constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition as well), it is permitted in cases of need, such as when one is in pain (see Day___), 2440 to fulfill a mitzvah, to fulfill a Shabbos need, 2441 to save an animal from distress, 2442 and sometimes, to avoid a major loss. Practical Applications • If a child left keys to a house or shul in a tree, one may ask a non-Jew to retrieve them. This is because climbing a tree is a Rabbinic prohibition, and asking a non-Jew to do it is also Rabbinic, and one needs the keys to eat or sleep at home or to get into a shul. • If one left a shofar in an unlocked car on Rosh HaShanah, he may ask a non-Jew to get it if there are no electric switches or lights that will turn on. This is because opening the car constitutes a transgression of muktzeh , and asking a non-Jew to retrieve the keys is also Rabbinic, and one needs the shofar for the mitzvah . Even if the car was locked or had electric switches, since there may be possible reasons to be lenient, one should consult a Rav . • If there is an item of any category of muktzeh lying around and the space is needed for guests to sleep, 2443 one may ask a non-Jew to move it. This is because muktzeh is Rabbinic, and asking the non-Jew to move it is also Rabbinic, and one needs the space for the mitzvah of hachnasas orchim . • If an animal is entangled in a fence or stuck in a puddle, one may ask a non-Jew to save it. This is because moving animals constitutes the Rabbinic prohibition of muktzeh , and asking a non-Jew to do it is also Rabbinic, and Chazal were lenient when it comes to saving animals from distress (See Day___). 2444 A Word of Caution This is only allowed in a case where both relevant prohibitions are Rabbinic. One must be certain that the prohibition being performed by the non-Jew is only Rabbinic. Furthermore, one must be clear that it is a real need or mitzvah. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a Rav before using this leniency. Moreover, the Poskim say that one should not use this leniency regularly. 2445",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2440.

We will now bring a few more practical applications of this leniency. It bears repeating that one must be certain that the prohibition being performed by the non-Jew is only Rabbinic. More Practical Applications • One may ask a non-Jew to carry food that is truly necessary for Shabbos in a karmelis , even where there is no eiruv . This is because carrying in such an area constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, and asking a non-Jew to do it also constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, and Chazal were lenient for the sake of a Shabbos need. Note that the non-Jew must pick up and put down the food himself. The Jew may not give it to him or take it from him at any stage. 2446 • If one finds chametz on Pesach or on Shabbos before or during Pesach, he may ask a non-Jew to throw it away. This is because during these times chametz is muktzeh (a Rabbinic prohibition), and asking a non- Jew to move it also constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, and there is a major need. 2447 • One may ask a non-Jew to pour water into baby cereal for a child to eat, as long as it remains a thin mixture. This is because the act of pouring constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition (based on lash [kneading] [see Day___]), and asking a non-Jew to do it also constitutes a Rabbinic prohi- bition, and it is permitted for the sake of a child. Note that it may even be permitted for the non-Jew to mix them into each other (the Torah prohibition of lash ), depending on the age and state of health of the child. 2448 In such cases, one should a consult a Rav beforehand. • One may ask a non-Jew to sweep the sukkah clean for the meal or to sleep in. This is because sweeping an untiled surface constitutes a Rab- binic prohibition (see Day___), and asking a non-Jew to sweep it also constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition, and it is permitted for the sake of the mitzvah of sitting or sleeping in a sukkah. 2449 • A woman who needs to go to the mikvah but forgot to cut her fingernails before Shabbos should ask a non-Jew to cut them preferably by hand, and if necessary, with a nail clipper. 2450",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2446.

406,03/09/2026,"AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: DOUBLE  D’RABBANAN IN CASES OF NEED,  CONTINUED","We are discussing the leniency known as shvus d’shvus b’makom tzorech (a Rabbinic prohibition on a Rabbinic prohibition in a case of need). It bears re- peating that one must be certain that the prohibition being performed by the non-Jew is only Rabbinic. Furthermore, one must be clear that it is a real need or mitzvah. Therefore, it is advisable to consult a Rav before using this leniency. Moreover, the Poskim say that one should not use this leniency regularly. 2451 Until now, we have dealt with Rabbinic prohibitions that stand on their own, like climbing trees, moving muktzeh items, and flattening floors. However, many Rabbinic prohibitions are acts that could result in Torah melachos , but lack certain critical elements necessary to categorize them as Torah prohibitions (see Days__—68 for details). Does the leniency of a double d’Rabbanan in a case of need apply to this type of Rabbinic prohibition? Shinui A classic example is a shinui — when something is done in a different man- ner from the way it is usually done. When a Torah melachah is performed with a shinui , it is no longer classified as a Torah prohibition, as it has changed from the typical melachah itself. However, it is still Rabbinically prohibited. Is the halachah in a case of a melachah done with a shinui more stringent than the Rabbinic prohibitions mentioned above, because the melachah itself is still occurring? There is much debate about this. 2452 Although the Mishnah Berurah is lenient in certain cases, 2453 one must consult a Rav before applying this leniency to a melachah that is done with a shinui . As a guideline, the following thought process is considered credible, and may be applied: Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv____ and Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach____ distin- guished between a shinui that produces an inferior result to what would result with a normal melachah , and a shinui that ultimately causes the same result. In both cases, it is a Rabbinic prohibition, but where the result is inferior, it is less of a melachah , and using this leniency is permitted. However, where the result is identical, this leniency may not be used. An Example of This Distinction • If one taps a light switch with his elbow, it is abnormal, and qualifies as a shinui . However, the light would not have been different if one had switched it on normally. The quality of the act is the same, and so, one may not ask a non-Jew to switch on a light abnormally for a great personal need. • On the other hand, if one writes with his weaker hand, the quality of the writing will certainly be inferior to that of his natural handwriting. Therefore, one may ask a non-Jew to write with his left hand in a case of a great need. Note that in cases in which the non-Jew was told to do the act with a shinui , and he decided to do it normally, one may still benefit from that melachah , unless the expectation of the non-Jew doing it in such an unusual way was unreasonable. In other words, this leniency (telling a non-Jew to do a melachah with a shinui in cases where the result will be inferior) does not apply if the non-Jew will almost certainly still do it in the normal way. 2456",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2451.

We have seen that the leniency applies to inherent Rabbinic decrees such as climbing trees, swimming, and moving muktzeh items. We are exploring whether it applies to acts that result in a melachah , but lack certain criteria that are required in order to categorize them as full Torah prohibitions. Melachah SheEino Tzrichah L’Gufah Another example of a Torah prohibition that is downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition is a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah — an act in which the purpose and intention of the person doing the melachah is not the melachah itself, but rather, some side benefit. Although a Torah melachah is accomplished, the act lacks the purpose and intent necessary to be categorized as a Torah prohibition, and is therefore downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition. Again, the question is whether a melachah that is done for a different pur- pose is a more stringent Rabbinic prohibition, because the melachah itself is still accomplished. Here again, there is a dispute. Although the Mishnah Berurah rules lenient- ly____ in certain cases, 2458 one must consult a Rav before asking a non-Jew to do a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah . Examples Where the Mishnah Berurah Is Lenient In the following cases, the Mishnah Berurah rules that one may ask a non-Jew to do a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah in a case of great need. • If wet mud is stuck to a garment, one may rub it from the inside____ (without using water____ ) if the dirt will still be visible afterwards. 2461 However, once the mud has dried, there is an additional Rabbinic pro- hibition of tochen (grinding), being that the intention of the grinding is not to break down the mud, but rather, to remove it from the garment (a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah ). Therefore, in a case of great need (such as where it will be an embarrassment for the person to be seen that way), one may ask a non-Jew to break it down. 2462 • Removing a fingernail constitutes the melachah of gozez (shearing) if one did so in order to use the nail. Removing a nail merely to get rid of it is a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah , and is downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition. If a woman forgot to cut her nails before going to the mik- vah on Friday night, she should ideally ask a non-Jew to remove them with her hand (a shinui ). However, if required, she may even ask the non-Jew to use a nail clipper. 2463",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2457. Mishnah Berurah  340:3.

We have seen that the leniency applies to inherent Rabbinic decrees such as climbing trees, swimming, and moving muktzeh items. We also explored whether it applies to a prohibition that results in a Torah melachah , but because it lacks certain qualifications, is downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition. We discussed two examples of this so far: performing a melachah with a shinui (abnormally) and a melachah she’eino tzrichah l’gufah (doing the melachah for a different purpose). Grama Another example of a melachah that is downgraded to a Rabbinic prohibition is a grama — setting up a situation that will indirectly cause a melachah . A grama is considered a lesser form of melachah than the others that we have discussed so far, as here, the act is further removed from the melachah that is ultimately accomplished. Because of this, there are rare situations where even a Jew is permitted to do a grama (see footnote). 2464 Therefore, in the case of a grama , the leniency of a double d’Rabbanan in a case of great need applies. One may ask a non-Jew to perform an act that is a grama in cases of great need. 2465 Practical Applications • If one requires light for a mitzvah or Shabbos need, he may ask a non-Jew to adjust a timer so that the lights will turn on earlier. However, he may not ask the non-Jew to turn on the lights, nor may he ask the non-Jew to adjust the timer to turn on the lights immediately. • If there is stinking animal residue causing a nuisance on the porch, one may ask a non-Jew to wash it down even though the water will eventually flow off the pavement onto grass.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2464.

409,06/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  A PERMISSIBLE WAY EXISTS,"We have mentioned that there is a limited leniency allowing one to benefit from the melachah of a non-Jew in cases where a Jew himself could have done the same thing in a permissible way. Regarding this leniency, the Mishnah Berurah seems to conclude that one should ideally not benefit if the act is a Torah-prohibited melachah . 2466 Still, one is permitted to benefit from such an act immediately after Shabbos (without waiting the amount of time that it would have taken to do the melachah after Shabbos). 2467 However, if the act was Rabbinically prohibited, one may benefit from it if there is a great need (see Day___). 2468 (Note that there may be leniencies even when a Torah melachah was done. In such a case, one should consult a Rav . 2469 ) Asking a Non-Jew to Do Something That Could Be Done Without a Melachah That being the case, let us now clarify the halachah regarding asking a non- Jew to do an act that a Jew could have done in a permitted way. 2470 According to some Poskim , being that there is a permitted way to do the act, if the non-Jew decides to do it with a melachah , he is essentially doing the melachah for his own convenience. 2471 However, here there is a critical distinction. If the Jew will get a direct and immediate benefit from the act being done through a melachah , and the non-Jew knows this, it is forbidden. This has many practical consequences regarding cleaning ladies. Washing Dishes In cases of need, one may ask a non-Jew to turn on a hot-water faucet that gets its water from an electric or solar boiler, as it constitutes a psik reisha (an act that inevitably results in a melachah ). The greater issue is regarding washing the dishes, which may involve the melachah of sechitah (squeezing). According to some Poskim , one may tell a cleaning lady to wash the dishes even though she will likely do so by squeezing a cloth or sponge or even by turning on a silent dishwasher, since she will only do so for her own convenience. However, one cannot tell a cleaning lady to wash the dishes knowing that she will certainly turn on the gas boiler in order to do so. This is because the cleaning lady certainly knows that the intention is for her employer to also ben- efit from her melachah . Furthermore, one may not allow her to clean the dishes if she will use a noisy dishwasher, since that is considered a zilzul Shabbos (showing disrespect for Shabbos by doing weekday acts). Cleaning the Floor According to some Poskim , one can ask a cleaning lady to “clean the floor” even though she will likely use a mop, which constitutes the melachah of sechitah (squeezing). This is because it is possible for her to clean the floor by pouring water on it and pushing it outside. The only reason she chooses to use a mop is for her convenience. 2472 But one may not allow her to clean the carpet if she will use a vacuum clean- er, since that makes a major noise and is considered zilzul Shabbos (showing disrespect for Shabbos by doing weekday acts). Second-Floor Deliveries According to some Poskim , one may ask a non-Jew to bring something to the second floor, even though it is possible that he may use an elevator. 2473 Looking for Something in a Dark Room According to these Poskim , one may ask a non-Jew to bring something from a dark room even though he knows that the non-Jew will likely turn the lights on to find it. However, he may not tell the non-Jew to go with him to look for the item, since it is then obvious that the non-Jew’s melachah is also for the Jew. 2474 It is worth noting that some Poskim are strict in this regard, and forbid asking a non-Jew to do something if the way that he does that act during the week is a melachah . 2475",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2466.

410,07/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: BENEFITING FROM MELACHAH DONE BY A  NON-JEW FOR A SICK PERSON,"We have already seen that one is required to transgress Shabbos if there is even the slightest possibility of danger to a Jewish life. We also said that in certain cases, one may ask a non-Jew to help a sick or elderly person or a child even if there is no danger (see Days___, 296, and___ for details regarding which kinds of people fall into these categories). If a non-Jew performed a melachah for a sick Jew, any Jew may benefit from that melachah , 2476 provided that: 1. The melachah is such that the melachah of the non-Jew would not need to be increased if more people were benefiting from it, 2477 and_. The benefit is not muktzeh . 2478 If the melachah done has either of these two qualities, a healthy Jew may only benefit from it after Shabbos. • If a person who was sick to the point that he needed bed rest asked a non-Jew to switch on the light for him, a healthy Jew may also benefit from that light. This is because the melachah involves only one flick of the switch, regardless of the number of people who will benefit from the light. Furthermore, there is no issue of muktzeh presented by the light. • If a person who was sick to the point that he needed bed rest asked a non-Jew to boil water for him because he needed it, a healthy Jew may not use that water on Shabbos. This is because the non-Jew may possibly end up doing more because of the extra person’s presence, by adding more water. Because this melachah varies based on the number of peo- ple that benefit from it, a healthy person is prohibited from benefiting. Furthermore, the hot water is muktzeh for the healthy Jew. 2479",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2476. Mishnah Berurah  276:8.

411,08/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  WARMING UP FOOD,"We will now discuss a few practical issues that can arise regarding non-Jews warming up food. Cooking Cooking on Shabbos constitutes the Torah prohibition of bishul . If the food is completely raw, one may not ask a non-Jew to cook it. If a non-Jew cooks it for a Jew, that food may not be eaten on Shabbos, nor for the amount of time that it would have taken to cook the food after Shabbos. • If one inadvertently left soup with a raw vegetable off of the stove, he may not ask a non-Jewish cleaning lady to put it back on. Warming Up If food is already fully cooked and it has no gravy, or the gravy was hot and is now still warm, the Torah prohibition does not apply to warming it up. However, one is still Rabbinically prohibited to place it directly on a heat source, even if it is covered (known as chazarah [returning food to a heat source] — see Day__). Moreover, one may not ask a non-Jew to do so. However, one may place food that is fully cooked with no gravy or with gravy that is still warm onto an upside-down pot on the heat source. This is permitted even for a Jew. If placing the food on a pot will not make the food hot enough, and the food is necessary for Shabbos, some Poskim permit asking a non-Jew to place it directly on the covered heat source. 2480 However, if the food is not necessary for Shabbos, one may not ask a non-Jew to put it directly on the heat source, and he must object if the non-Jew tries to. Moreover, if the non-Jew did so, a Jew must remove it from the heat source. If he did not remove it, the food is generally permitted to eat. 2481 A Rav should be consulted. • The following is a common scenario: If the cleaning lady sees that one has forgotten to put the cholent on the hot plate before Shabbos, she will try to put it on. If it is necessary for the Shabbos meal (there will not be enough food otherwise), some Poskim even permit asking her to put it on, provided that it was already cooked and is dry (even if it is now cold). However, if there is enough food without it, one may not ask the cleaning lady to put it on the hot plate. One must object if the cleaning lady starts to do so, and if she did so, he must remove it from the hot plate. Plugging in a Hot Plate If one forgot to plug in a hot plate, he may not ask a non-Jew to plug it in, as generating heat constitutes the melachah of maavir (lighting a fire) (and, ac- cording to some opinions, boneh [building], and the Rabbinic prohibition of molid [creating]). If the non-Jew did so, a Jew may not use it. Even if one has food that is hot and on a different hot plate, he may not benefit from the one that the non-Jew plugged in.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2480. Biur Halachah  253:5, “ Lehachem .” However, it should be noted that other  Poskim  prohibit  this — see  Chazon Ish  37:21, “ V’Nireh .”

412,09/09/2026,"AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  WARMING UP FOOD, CONTINUED - FOOD","Food on a Heat Source Before Shabbos We have seen that there is a Rabbinic prohibition to leave food that is less than one-third cooked on an uncovered stove before Shabbos, as Chazal feared that one would increase the heat on Shabbos to quicken the cooking process. This prohibition is known as shehiyah (see Day__). One may not ask a non-Jew to do this either. If a non-Jew did so (even though it was before Shabbos), one may not benefit from the food on Shabbos, and he must wait for the amount of time that it would have taken for the food to become cooked after Shabbos. 2482 • If a cleaning lady placed an uncooked chicken on an uncovered flame before Shabbos, the chicken may not be eaten until the amount of time that it would have taken the chicken to be cooked after Shabbos. (Moreover, if she lit the flame, the chicken may not be eaten at all, as it constitutes bishul akum .) If the non-Jew left food that was planned for the day meal on an uncovered heat source, one is permitted to be lenient. 2483 Still, the Mishnah Berurah says that one may not plan to do this ( lechatchilah ), and moreover, it is forbidden to eat such food if this “mistake” happens regularly____ (see Day__). Wrapping Food We have seen that there is a Rabbinic prohibition to significantly wrap a food while it is on a heat source both before and on Shabbos, and to wrap a food off of a heat source on Shabbos. This prohibition is known as hatmanah (see Day__). Regarding asking a non-Jew to do so, it depends on the case. While the food is on the heat source, asking a non-Jew to wrap it (before or on Shabbos) is prohibited, and if one did ask, the food may not be eaten on Shab- bos. However, if the non-Jew did it for his own benefit, the food is permitted. 2485 Once the food is off of the heat source, some Poskim allow one to ask a non- Jew to wrap the food with towels to keep it hot____ if he really needs to retain the heat for a Shabbos meal. However, if he does not really need the food to be hot for a Shabbos meal, he may not ask the non-Jew to wrap it up. These halachos can be quite complicated. One may need to consult a Rav .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2482. Mishnah Berurah  253:1 and 254:20.

413,10/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  MELACHOS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN  PERFORMED ON SHABBOS;   THE SECOND DAY OF YOM TOV,"We have seen that if a non-Jew did melachah for a Jew, whether or not he was asked to, one may not benefit from it until the amount of time that it would have taken to accomplish that act passes after Shabbos. Not Sure If It Was Done on Shabbos If it is unclear if the melachah was done on Shabbos or not, one must still wait to benefit from it for the amount of time that it would have taken to accomplish it after Shabbos. 2487 However, if the benefit is for a mitzvah , one may be lenient and use it on Shabbos. 2488 • Chazal prohibited going more than_,000 amos (0.6 miles/960 meters) beyond the last house of a city on Shabbos. This is called “going outside the techum (boundary).” This halachah applies even to walking (see Day___). If a non-Jew used his car to bring fruit from more than_.6 miles/960 meters outside of the city, but it is unclear if he dropped them off before Shabbos, one must wait for the amount of time that it would have taken to bring them after Shabbos before eating them. • If a non-Jew brought grape juice ( mevushal ) from outside of the city using his car, and it is unclear if it was Shabbos when he arrived, one may use it if he requires that grape juice for Kiddush or Havdalah. When Yom Tov Falls Out on Sunday When a non-Jew does a melachah for a Jew on Shabbos, and the following night is Yom Tov, one must wait after Yom Tov for the amount of time that it would take to do the act before benefiting from it. 2489 (This is certainly true regarding a melachah done on Rosh HaShanah, as the second day of Rosh Ha- Shanah has the same status as the first day.) However, regarding the second day of Yom Tov as kept in the Diaspora, there is a dispute whether one is also required not to benefit from a melachah that was done two days earlier, on Shabbos. In such a case, one must wait until after Yom Tov (Monday night). 2490 • If Pesach falls out on Saturday night, a Jew in the Diaspora may only ben- efit from any melachah done by a non-Jew on Shabbos once the amount of time that it would take to do the melachah passed on Monday night. 2491 When Yom Tov Falls Out on Thursday When a non-Jew does melachah for a Jew on the first of two days of Yom Tov (a Thursday), the Jew need not wait until all three days have passed in order to benefit. He may benefit on Shabbos after waiting for the amount of time that it would take to do the melachah . 2492 • If the first day of Pesach falls on Thursday (i.e., Wednesday night), one may benefit from the melachah on Friday night, after waiting for the amount of time that it would take to do the melachah .",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2486.

414,11/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: BUSINESS,"We have seen that one may not instruct a non-Jew to do melachah , nor ben- efit from a melachah done by a non-Jew. Although a detailed analysis of the Halachic impact of amirah l’nochri on business is beyond the scope of this book, and one should consult a Rav in all cases, we will now discuss some important principles, examples, and cases. Renting to a Non-Jew One may not rent any property or equipment that involves doing a melachah to a non-Jew. Although the non-Jew is renting it or working there for his own benefit, Chazal were concerned about maris ayin — that the onlooker would assume that the non-Jew is being employed by the Jew to do melachah on Shab- bos. This is true even if the rental agreement is for a set period of time. However, this prohibition is limited to Jewish areas. One may rent out a property that is not in a Jewish area, as an onlooker is unlikely to think that the non-Jew is employed by a Jew. Moreover, if the property has been rented out to the non-Jew for years and it is known to all that the operation is his, it is permitted. Similarly, in places where it is common to rent to non-Jews, in a way that the onlooker would assume that those working at the establishment are doing so for themselves, it is permitted. 2493 A publication in the media or a sign that indicates that the property is not owned by Jews would also suffice. However, if the rental is per day, not only is it maris ayin , it is also considered like the Jewish owner is working on Shabbos, regardless of where the property is situated and even whether it is common to rent to non-Jews. 2494 Either way, one must be even more careful not to rent out such an establish- ment to a Jew who does not observe Shabbos, due to the prohibition to cause another Jew to sin. 2495 Operating a Company on Shabbos One may not employ non-Jewish workers to operate a company or factory on Shabbos, as the Jew owns and benefits from all production and every trans- action (i.e., if the business is closed on Shabbos, the Jew will lose out____ ). This is not just maris ayin , and applies anywhere. However, some Poskim permit one to make an arrangement with the non-Jewish managers and workers under which they will receive a specific, sig- nificant bonus (in addition to their regular salaries) for anything voluntarily produced or sold on Shabbos. 2497 In that way, they are effectively working for themselves, as they would be able to close the business on Shabbos if they choose to. Note that this exception only applies where there is no maris ayin ; therefore, the business must be located either in a non-Jewish area or in a place where an onlooker will assume that they are working for their own benefit. In cases where there is maris ayin , such an arrangement does not help. Furthermore, it should be noted that this ruling is not unanimous, and a Rav should be consulted before relying on it. Agents Based on the above, a Jew may allow a non-Jewish agent to sell his property or belongings on Shabbos (as part of the general agreement to be an agent), as the non-Jew is working on Shabbos for his own benefit. 2498 However, there are a few conditions. Maris ayin still applies if the property is in a Jewish area or is known to belong to a Jew, because an onlooker may assume that the agent was hired specifically to work on Shabbos. In such a case, it is forbidden. Moreover, the Jew may not be involved or present during a sale.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2493. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  243:2.

415,12/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  JOBS OVER SHABBOS,"We have seen that one may not employ a non-Jew to work for him on Shabbos. If the Work Can Be Completed Before Shabbos However, one may give a non-Jew a job on Friday, provided that there is enough time for him to complete it before Shabbos. 2499 • One may hand in a cell phone to a non-Jewish repairman on Friday if there is enough time for him to fix it before Shabbos. It is not relevant whether the non-Jew ends up fixing it on Shabbos. This is also unlikely to cause suspicion, as it is merely one phone out of many that are there for repair in the non-Jew’s shop. If the Work Cannot Be Completed Before Shabbos One may not give a non-Jew a job to do on Friday if there is no way that he can complete it before or after Shabbos. But if the Jew does not stipulate when the the job must be completed or there is enough time for the job to be com- pleted before or after Shabbos, it is permitted under the following conditions: 2500_. A set price must be arranged before Shabbos. 2. The Jew may not ask that the object be ready for pickup immediate- ly after Shabbos, so that there is no pressure for the non-Jew to work on Shabbos. 2501 The fact that the non-Jew ultimately does the job on Shabbos is irrelevant. 3. Maris ayin still applies, and therefore, this is only permitted in a non-Jewish area or in the non-Jew’s house. 2502 Alternatively, it is per- mitted if it is not discernible that the object belongs to a Jew. 2503_. The work must not be done on the Jew’s property. 2504 • One may give in clothing to a non-Jewish dry cleaner late on Friday, provided that the prices are set, he does not request to pick up the clothing immediately after Shabbos, and the work is done in the dry cleaners store. 2505 • One may not give in a car to be repaired late on Friday and arrange to collect it on Sunday. This is because the likelihood is that the non-Jew will repair it on Shabbos, and there was no agreed-upon price. However, if they somehow arrange a price, it is permitted by conforming to the conditions listed above. We will soon add a further detail to this.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2499.

416,13/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI:  CONTRACT WORKERS,"An Item That Was Repaired on Shabbos We discussed the conditions under which one may give a non-Jew a job to do, even if he may conceivably do melachos on Shabbos as a result (see Day___). If the non-Jew chose to do the melachah on Shabbos, there is still a dispute whether one may benefit from the item on that Shabbos. 2506 The Rama rules that one may not benefit from that item before waiting for the amount of time that it would have taken to do the job after Shabbos. How- ever, he permits benefiting on Shabbos for a Shabbos need. 2507 This is because the non-Jew only did the job on Shabbos for his own gain (i.e., he wanted to finish the job as soon as possible for his own convenience). In a case where the exact time of when the melachah was performed is in doubt, all agree that one may benefit on Shabbos. Furthermore, if the bulk of the melachah was done before Shabbos and the item was already usable by then, the melachah done on Shabbos is not considered significant, and one may benefit from it on Shabbos, according to all opinions. 2508 • A person handed in a pair of pants to a non-Jewish tailor to be mended on Friday, fixed a price with him, and never pressured him to finish it for immediately after Shabbos. If the tailor brings the pants back on that Shabbos (within the area that the Jew is also permitted to do so), he may not wear them. However, if he now needs them for Shabbos (for instance, his only other pair ripped), he may. Alternatively, he may wear them if the non-Jew merely did the finishing touches on Shabbos, or if he does not know for certain that the non-Jew did the tailoring on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2506.

417,14/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: WORK IN PUBLIC,"Employing a Non-Jew in Public A Jew may never employ a non-Jew to do melachah on Shabbos if he pays him by the day. Furthermore, any public job that may cause an onlooker to suspect that the non-Jew was employed to do it on Shabbos is also forbidden because of maris ayin (the prohibition to do something that looks like it is forbidden). Even in places where the locals are always employed on a job-by-job basis, there is a dispute among the Poskim , and one should consult a Rav before engaging in the project. 2509 Additionally, one may never allow workers to do jobs on his property on Shabbos, regardless of how he employs them and what the local practice is. • If one is constructing a factory out of town (not in a Jewish area), he may not pay the non-Jewish workers by the day (unless he forbids them to work there on Shabbos). He may pay them a set amount for the job. Even if the common practice is only to pay by the job, there is a dispute among the Poskim whether one may do so. • One may not allow non-Jews to build or work on his house on Shabbos, or build a shopping mall in a Jewish area. If It Was Built We have seen that one may not employ a non-Jew to build a house on Shab- bos if he pays him by the day. If this halachah was transgressed, one may not enter such a building. 2510 In certain cases, there may be room to be lenient, and one should consult a Rav . However, although the prohibition of maris ayin still applies if one only paid a worker by the job (and not by the day) and the work is in a Jewish area, one may enter such a building if need be. 2511 As we have seen, the halachos of employing non-Jews are complicated and vary according to each situation. It is thus worth emphasizing the need to consult a Rav before engaging in such a situation.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2509. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  244:1 and 244:7.

418,15/09/2026,AMIRAH L’NOCHRI: NON-JEWISH  PARTNERS OR CO-OWNERS,"We will now discuss the halachos that apply to one who has a business together with a non-Jewish partner or co-owner. In all practical applications of these halachos, a Rav should be consulted. If They Work Different Hours If the non-Jew and the Jew do not work at the business during the same hours, the business can remain open on Shabbos under the following conditions. At the very beginning of the partnership, the Jew must stipulate to the non-Jew- ish partner or co-owner that the Jew has no responsibility or ownership of the business on Saturdays, and that it will be the non-Jew’s business and profits alone on that day. In exchange, the Jew may take the responsibility, work, and profits of a different day of the week. 2512 If the profits for each day are not quantifiable, an estimate or some similar compromise can be made. Note that such an agreement is also required if the business employs non-Jewish workers. If one did not initially make such a stipulation, he may not do so later, be- cause at that point, it is as if the non-Jew is already the Jew’s agent for Satur- days. 2513 A Rav should be consulted for solutions, especially if they did happen to follow that format of the non-Jew working on Saturdays and the Jew working an extra weekday. 2514 If They Work the Same Hours If the partners work in a business at the same times during the week, the halachah is more lenient. Even if there was no initial agreement, the Jew may create one at any point. In this case, the profits can be shared equally. This is because the work was always there for the non-Jew to do, and it does not appear as if he is acting as an agent of the Jew. These are merely the basic guidelines regarding non-Jews and business. Without consulting a Rav in all cases, one is almost certain to transgress Shabbos in some form.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2512. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  245:1.

419,16/09/2026,SECHAR SHABBOS (EARNING MONEY  FOR SHABBOS WORK) - THE PROHIBITION,"The Prohibition One may not be paid for work done on Shabbos, even if the work does not involve a melachah . Chazal prohibited this because it resembles business deal- ings, which are forbidden on Shabbos. Chazal were concerned that one would come to transgress the Torah prohibition of kosev (writing). 2515 The prohibition applies even if the employer and employee drew up the arrangement before Shabbos, and agreed that payment would be made after Shabbos. 2516 The prohibition applies to both the employer and the employee, 2517 regardless of what form the payment takes. (We will discuss the limitations that Chazal established within the prohibition.) • One may not be employed as a waiter at a catered function on Shabbos even if he will not be doing any melachah . Likewise, a caterer may not hire a Jewish waiter to work on Shabbos. This is true even if the contract was finalized before Shabbos, and even if the waiter is being paid in food or after Shabbos. • One may not rent out his house for Shabbos alone. 2518 The prohibition only applies to rentals and services rendered, but one may provide goods with the expectation of being paid after Shabbos. • If he trusts him, the owner of a fruit store can give his fellow Jew a bag of oranges on Shabbos with the expectation of being paid after Shab- bos. However, he may not state this expectation out loud. (See Days___—398 for the halachos of having businesses open on Shabbos.)",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2515. Mishnah Berurah  306:16.

420,17/09/2026,SECHAR SHABBOS:  WHEN IT IS PERMITTED,"We have seen that one may not receive or pay money for work on Shabbos, even when it does not involve a melachah . Havlaah The above prohibition only applies for work that is specific to Shabbos. However, if the work is part of an agreement to work during the week as well, it is permitted. This is known as havlaah — absorbing Shabbos payment into payment for the rest of the job. 2519 In most cases, this requires a weekly or month- ly agreement. Even if one is paid by the hour or day, if the agreement requires weekday work as well, it is permitted. 2520 (Note that it is prohibited to discuss payment on Shabbos.) • One may be paid to be a caretaker of an institution over Shabbos if he is also required to do some relevant work during the week. It is not viewed as being hired just for Shabbos. • If one is paid to provide education to children on Shabbos, he should be paid by the week, and do some preparation during the weekday. • Although renting out an apartment for Shabbos alone is forbidden, if one stipulates that the rental will begin some time before Shabbos or end some time after Shabbos, it is permitted. Interest The same is true if one loans money to a non-Jew with interest. The interest may not be calculated by the day. (Any way other than by the day is permit- ted.) 2521 This would theoretically apply to interest that a Jew receives from a non-Jewish bank. However, this is not usually relevant, as daily interest rates are calculated from midnight to midnight, and are therefore absorbed into the portion of the day that is not Shabbos. 2522 It becomes a greater issue when Shabbos falls out next to Yom Tov, and by the two days of Rosh HaShanah. In these instances, there is a full day being paid for without any absorption into the weekday. The Poskim say that one should calculate that interest and give it to charity, so that he does not benefit from money earned over Shabbos or Yom Tov. Note that on a normal Yom Tov in the Diaspora, where there are always two consecutive days, one may be lenient, as one of the days is not actually Yom Tov.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2519.

421,18/09/2026,SECHAR SHABBOS: MORE LENIENCIES,"We have seen that one may not receive or pay money for work on Shabbos, even when it does not involve a melachah . However, if the Shabbos work is built into a weekly or monthly contract, and some work is done during the week, it is permitted. Renting a Car One may rent or lease a car for an extended period, even though he is paying for Shabbos hours. This is because the contract is a general weekly or monthly contract. Even a daily contract will generally be permitted as long as it includes a portion that is not Shabbos. Halls Halls may be rented out for Shabbos functions, provided that the client will have access and the ability to use it before or after Shabbos. Hotels One may stay in a Jewish-owned hotel even though the Jewish owner will receive money for Shabbos. This is because a stay in a hotel includes time before and after Shabbos. Furthermore, one is paying for many other services that need to take place before Shabbos, such as cleaning, laundry, and food preparation. 2523 However, if one somehow rents an apartment just for Shabbos, and requires no other accommodations (linen, laundry, food, etc.), he may not pay the Jewish landlord. Rather, he must build in some extra usage of the apartment before or after Shabbos. Working for a Mitzvah There is a dispute among the Poskim whether this prohibition applies to one whose work is a mitzvah, 2524 such as a chazzan, baal korei (Torah reader), or baal toke’a (shofar blower) who is paid per service or reading. 2525 However, even ac- cording to those who permit it, one will not see blessing from money earned for Shabbos work. Therefore, he should build weekday work into the agreement. 2526 • One who is a chazzan on Rosh HaShanah should agree to be paid for the entire period of the Days of Awe, including some weekday service, such as Selichos or a Torah class. • One who is paid to be a regular chazzan on Shabbos should ideally not have a formal agreement to be paid for his work. It is preferable to accept any payment as a gift. Alternatively, if the chazzan prepares his services by practicing his techniques and tunes during the week, the work that he does on Shabbos is absorbed into it. 2527 To Save a Life A doctor, midwife, and birth coach (in most cases) may be paid for Shabbos work. This is because we do not want anything to cause them to hesitate regard- ing their jobs, as their services are often required in life-threatening situations. Therefore, they may be paid even when the situation is not life-threatening. (However, one may not discuss being paid on Shabbos, a prohibition which we will discuss. 2528 )",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2523. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  28:70.

422,19/09/2026,HACHANAH  (PREPARING FOR AFTER SHABBOS),"Chazal prohibited doing any action or saying anything on Shabbos or Yom Tov____ that is not relevant for Shabbos or Yom Tov. 2530 This is known as hacha- nah (preparing). The prohibition applies to an action on any holy day whose benefit will only apply after that day: • On Shabbos for after Shabbos • On Yom Tov for after Yom Tov • On Yom Tov for Chol HaMoed • On Shabbos for the Yom Tov that follows it • On Yom Tov for Shabbos that follows it (except if there is an eiruv tav- shilin ) • On the first day of Yom Tov for the second day of Yom Tov • One may not prepare food on Shabbos that will only be eaten after Shabbos. • One who plans to travel after Shabbos may not pack on Shabbos. • One should preferably not fold a tallis at all on Shabbos, as the next use of the tallis will only be the following morning____ (see Day___). • One may not roll a Sefer Torah to the place where it will be read after Shabbos. 2532 (We will see that one may do so if he is learning from the Torah while doing so.) • If Pesach falls out on Saturday night, one should preferably not wash chametz dishes on Shabbos, as it is clear that he will not use them for a Shabbos need. Ideally, he should use disposables and throw them out after using them for chametz . If he uses dishes, he may ask a non-Jew to clean them. If this is not possible, he should do the minimal effort required to remove the chametz , without fully washing the dishes. 2533 NOTE: We will learn that even when preparing for after Shabbos is somehow permitted, one is not allowed to express that he is doing so for that purpose.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2529.

It must be stressed that even when hachanah is permitted, it must not be expressed in words. To Be Used for Shabbos Also Where there is some use to be gained on Shabbos, it is permitted. • One may not bring out wine for Havdalah from the garage while it is still Shabbos. However, he may bring out wine for seudah shelishis even though he also plans to use it for Havdalah, but he must not express in words that his intention is really for after Shabbos. 2534 • One may not take along a siddur when walking to shul on Shabbos (indoors, or in a place where carrying is permissible) in order to daven Maariv on Motzaei Shabbos, as he is clearly doing so for after Shabbos. However, he may do so if he will use it for some other purpose, such as reciting Tehillim before Shabbos ends. 2535 • One may not wash plates on Shabbos if there is no use for them. Some Poskim permit rinsing or soaking the dishes so that the oil and dirt will not congeal on them____ (but not fully cleaning them). One may wash plates that will be used on that day. 2537 Moreover, even if one only needs a few, he may still wash all of them. 2538 Some are stringent not to wash any plates if there are others available. • If leaving dirty plates around will genuinely bother a person, he may clean them, as that is considered a Shabbos need. However, if his main intent in cleaning them is to avoid having to clean them after Shabbos, it is forbidden. 2539 On the same basis, one may place dishes in a dish- washer so that they are out of the way (making sure to avoid any issues of borer [sorting]). 2540 The same goes for making beds — if keeping them unmade genuinely bothers the person, he is permitted to make them if he would do so during the week for the same reason.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2534.

Effortless Daily Activities One may perform an action that is a daily and effortless activity, and is therefore not an action that is identifiable for after Shabbos. However, one may not actually state that the action is for Motzaei Shabbos. 2541 • One may take his tallis home after Mussaf (in places where carrying is permitted). • One may return a sefer after learning from it even though the next usage will not be on Shabbos. • One may return food to a refrigerator or freezer even though the pur- pose of doing so is to keep it fresh for after Shabbos. • One can leave his house with his keys even though he will only return after Shabbos. 2542 Preventing Loss One may do an action to save an item from loss, provided that it does not require effort. 2543 • One may move non- muktzeh objects out of imminent rain, sun, or dirt in order to prevent them from being damaged, even if they will not be used on Shabbos. • One may invite a friend to a wedding that will take place during the week if this is the only opportunity and it will be a great loss to the guest if he feels uninvited. • As we have mentioned, one may return food to a refrigerator or freezer. Sleeping on Shabbos One can sleep on Shabbos, and doing so is a mitzvah, but verbalizing that one is going to sleep so that he will be refreshed for after Shabbos is forbidden. 2544",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2541.

425,22/09/2026,"HACHANAH: LENIENCIES, CONTINUED","We are discussing the prohibition to do something on Shabbos for use only after Shabbos. We said that one may do such an act if there is some use for it on Shabbos. We also said that one may do a normal daily activity if it is not obviously for after Shabbos, or if it is an act that prevents loss. We mentioned that in cases where such an act is permitted, one may not state that the act is for Motzaei Shabbos. We will now discuss a few more lenient cases. Uncertain If It Is for Shabbos One may do something on the chance that it may be needed on Shabbos even if he is uncertain that it will be needed. It should be noted that it becomes more obvious that an act is not for Shabbos as Shabbos draws to a close, and one may not do any action that is obviously for after Shabbos. 2545 • One may wash wine glasses on Shabbos on the chance that they will be needed, even though it is not a certainty. However, one may not wash them after seudah shelishis if it finishes after sunset, as at that point one may no longer drink anything other than water until Havdalah is recited. Making Beds One may not make the beds so that they are ready for Motzaei Shabbos. However, one may make the beds if it is possible that one will sleep on Shabbos, even if it is not a certainty. Moreover, if messy beds genuinely bother a person (during the week too), he may make them, as then the need is a Shabbos one, and not only for after Shabbos. 2546 Asking a Non-Jew to Prepare One may be lenient and ask a non-Jew to do an act of preparation for after Shabbos (if that act is not otherwise prohibited) if it is really necessary or for a mitzvah. However, he may not verbalize that the purpose of the act is for after Shabbos. 2547 • One may ask a non-Jew to clear off the table from seudah shelishis even though the table will not be used until after Shabbos. However, he may not mention that the request is for the purpose of having the table clear for Havdalah.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2545.

426,23/09/2026,HASHMAAS KOL (PLAYING  INSTRUMENTS ON SHABBOS),"Although on a Torah level, making music on Shabbos and Yom Tov is per- mitted (provided that no melachah is done), Chazal were concerned that doing so would lead to fixing instruments, which constitutes the melachos of boneh (building) or makkeh b’patish (making an item usable). Therefore, they prohib- ited making musical sounds. 2548 We will distinguish between instruments that are made for music and those that are not. We will also discuss making sounds with one’s hands or mouth. Instruments It is forbidden to use any instrument that is designated for making music or sounds, even if one is not using it for making music. Such an item is also muktzeh (usually under the category of a kli shemelachto l’issur , unless it is very valuable, in which case it is machmas chisaron kis ). • One may not use a piano or guitar, even merely to identify a musical note. • One may not blow a whistle on Shabbos, even if he is not using it for music. 2549 • One may not ring a bell (even if it is mechanical), as it is an item desig- nated to produce sound. • A tuning fork is an instrument designated to make sound, and is there- fore forbidden to use. 2550 However, see footnote. • A shofar is a considered a musical instrument, and may not be blown on Shabbos, even if it is not being used in order to make music. 2551 It is therefore muktzeh in the category of kli shemelachto l’issur (see Day___). 2552 On Rosh HaShanah, it may only be used for the mitzvah, but it is not muktzeh . However, when Rosh HaShanah falls out on Shabbos, the shofar is not blown, and it is therefore muktzeh . Not an Instrument One may make sounds using an item that is not a designated musical instru- ment, but only if he is not making music, or even a rhythm. • One may tap a spoon against glass in order to get people’s attention, provided that he is not making a specific tune or rhythm. 2553 • One may use a door knocker, as it is not designated for song or music, but rather for knocking. 2554 However, one may not bang it to a rhythm. • When one is singing zemiros , he may not use a spoon or even his hand to tap out the song’s tempo. 2555",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2548.

427,24/09/2026,HASHMAAS KOL: MAKING SOUND  WITH THE BODY,"We are discussing the prohibition to use a musical instrument. We said that using an instrument is forbidden even if it is not being used to make music, whereas something that is not a musical instrument is permitted as long as it is not being used to make music or create a rhythm. One’s Body One may not use his hands or any other part of the body to make music or tap out a rhythm, unless he does so with a shinui (abnormally). 2556 • One may not snap his fingers or clap his hands in order to make music or keep a beat, unless he does so in an unusual way. For instance, one may bang the back of one hand onto the palm of the other, in order to clap. • But one may clap normally (without a shinui ) in order to wake someone up or get their attention. 2557 At a Simchah Some Poskim are lenient and allow one to create music or to tap out rhythms with his body at a simchah that is a mitzvah. 2558 Moreover, we will see that while Chazal prohibited dancing, these Poskim permit it in these cases as well. 2559 • According to some Poskim , one may clap or dance around a chassan at his aufruf or sheva brachos . However, one may not do so at a birthday or a non-Torah speech. • According to some Poskim , one may clap or dance at a siyum (comple- tion of learning a segment of Torah). • One may dance or clap with the Torah on Simchas Torah. Singing and Whistling One may sing on Shabbos, even if he is creating music. Although blowing a whistle is prohibited (even if it is not being used for music), whistling with one’s mouth is permitted, even to create song. 2560 • A choir may sing a cappella. Even if they are imitating instruments, using one’s mouth alone is permitted. In Summary Using a musical instrument is always prohibited on Shabbos. Using an item that is not an instrument is forbidden only if used for music or to create a rhythm. Using one’s hands or body to create music or a rhythm is forbidden, but is per- mitted with a shinui . (Some Poskim permit it even without a shinui for a simchah that is a mitzvah.) Using one’s mouth is permitted even for song.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2556. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  339:3;  Mishnah Berurah  339:9.

429,26/09/2026,MIMTZO CHEFTZECHA: PURSUING  WEEKDAY INTERESTS,"Another halachah that is learned from the verse in Yeshayahu is that one may not pursue his own weekday interests on Shabbos. However, one may pursue the “interests” of Hashem, that is, mitzvos, even for after Shabbos. 2572 • On Shabbos, one may not ask a taxi driver to pick him up in order to go to the airport after Shabbos, as this is considered his own weekday interest. • One may not visit the house that he is building and decide where to place tiles or carpeting. Similarly, one may not discuss a new business venture with his partner. 2573 • One may organize a Torah tutor for after Shabbos, though he may not mention the exact sum being paid. 2574 Similarly, a shadchan may arrange shidduchim on Shabbos even though the prospective couple will only meet after Shabbos, but payment for doing so should not be discussed. • One may not organize a business meeting for after Shabbos. • When being called up for an aliyah on Shabbos, one may pledge to give tzedakah . 2575 (One should always say bli neder [without vowing] in order to avoid any possible infraction of an oath, which is very severe). Preparing for a Motzaei Shabbos Activity One may not go to a place where it is obvious that the purpose is for after Shabbos. However, this is only a problem if the future activity in question is itself forbidden on Shabbos. • One may not walk to his business towards the end of Shabbos, as it is obvious that his purpose is to work afterwards. Similarly, one may not wait at a bus stop towards the end of Shabbos, as it is obvious that he wishes to take a bus after Shabbos. However, if it is raining, or in a place where people are accustomed to use the bus stop for relaxing outside, waiting at a bus stop is permitted, as an onlooker will not assume that he is waiting for the bus. • One may not enter a shopping center on Shabbos, as it is obvious that he is doing so in order to buy something afterwards. (See the footnote for additional issues with doing so. 2576 ) However, one may walk on the street normally and look at goods in store windows. However, he may not investigate the prices. 2577",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2572. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  306:1;  Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  29:54.

430,27/09/2026,M’ASOS DERACHECHA: WALKING  DIFFERENTLY ON SHABBOS;  PARTAKING OF DELIGHTS ON SHABBOS,"M’Asos Derachecha Another halachah that is derived from the verse in Yeshayahu is that one must honor Shabbos by walking differently. The verse states, “And you will honor it (Shabbos) by avoiding walking your way,” and the Gemara interprets it to mean that one should not walk the same way that he walks during the week. 2578 One should walk slower on Shabbos, and one may certainly not run. 2579 However, if it is raining or there are other extenuating circumstances, one may run. 2580 Children are allowed to run and play, as that is a recreational activity for them. 2581 This change in walking is only regarding one’s own activities. One may run to do those things required by Hashem, such as running to shul or to learn Torah. Moreover, it is a mitzvah to do so, and show enthusiasm for Hashem’s word. Oneg Shabbos The verse states, “And if you call Shabbos a special delight for Hashem and you honor it.” We have discussed the requirements learned from these words in detail at the beginning of the book. In summary, we said that one should enjoy Shabbos by wearing special and clean clothes, serving special food, and baking bread in honor of Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2578.

431,28/09/2026,MEKACH U’MEMCHAR (DOING  BUSINESS ON SHABBOS),"Introduction Aside from the melachos involved in doing business on Shabbos, such as writing, typing, activating electricity, muktzeh , and other issues, there is also a separate prohibition to do business on Shabbos. The Ramban writes that this is a Torah prohibition, 2582 based on the verse that requires Shabbos to be a “ shabbason ” — a day in which there is a cessation of work. 2583 However, the Mishnah Berurah states that the general consensus is that it is a Rabbinic prohibition. Chazal were concerned that one would come to transgress the Torah melachah of kosev (writing). 2584 The prohibition applies to both the buyer and the seller. Therefore, trans- acting with a non-Jew is also forbidden. For a Mitzvah with Certain Conditions One may not transact even for the sake of a mitzvah. 2585 • One may not sell his chametz on erev Pesach that falls out on Shabbos. 2586 However, in certain mitzvah cases, one may buy something by being very vague, so that it does not appear like a business transaction. These are the con- ditions under which this is permitted: 1. One may not mention the price, showing a disregard for paying a bit more or a bit less. 2. One may not mention the exact measurements that he needs. How- ever, he may ask for a certain quantity. 2587_. One may not calculate the accumulated amount on the account at the merchant. 4. One may not mention the words “buy,” “sell,” or “pay.” As we have stated, this is only permitted for a mitzvah , not simply for one’s enjoyment. • If one needs soda for a kiddush , he may tell a store owner, “Give me seven bottles of soda and I’ll speak to you later about them.” 2588 One may even give over a non-money deposit without explicitly mentioning what it is for. 2589 • If one requires fruit for a kiddush , he may not ask for “the apples that cost fifty cents a pound/kilogram,” or “three pounds/kilograms of green apples.” However, he may say, “Please fill this bag with apples,” even if the bag holds a specific weight. 2590",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2582.

432,29/09/2026,MEKACH U’MEMCHAR:  SHOP OWNERS;  GUMBALL MACHINES;   INTERNET BUSINESSES,"We have seen that there is a separate prohibition of doing business on Shab- bos, aside from the other prohibitions that may occur when doing so. We will discuss a few applications. Shop Owners If a shop is owned by a Jew, and another Jew requests from him to open the shop so that he can obtain a certain item (based on the very limited leniency mentioned above in Day___, and assuming there are no electric doors, alarms, or other issues), the shop owner may not mention the bill, and certainly not the account balance. Furthermore, he may not do anything to remind himself of the sale, such as putting a clip on a buyer’s name in the book or using play money to recall the transaction later on. 2591 It is worth repeating that a shop owner who is particular not to use his goods at all before selling them renders them muktzeh , and the goods may not be handled at all. However, edible food is not muktzeh (see Day___). Gumball Machines One may not use a gumball or vending machine (or the like) on Shabbos, even if he has tokens (not money) to operate it, and even if it does not run on electricity. This falls under the prohibition of doing business on Shabbos. Internet Businesses If there is a real likelihood that irreligious Jews will use one’s website on Shabbos, he must close it down before Shabbos to avoid “placing a stumbling block in front of the blind.” He can and should put a notice on the site stating that it is closed due to Shabbos. 2592 If it is unlikely that Jews will visit the site, one may keep it open. The owner should, however, arrange that any money gained from transactions is not re- ceived until after Shabbos. In all cases, one should consult a Rav , as technicalities may affect the halachah. 2593 • One who owns a website that sells software must close it down for Shab- bos if the software has Jewish content or usually attracts Jews. However, if the software does not attract Jews, he may keep the site open, but he must arrange that the money will only be received after Shabbos. Moreover, if one sells physical items, the courier should only be issued instructions to deliver after Shabbos has ended. • One may keep a website open if it will not involve Jews and does not sell a product, even though he may get queries and requests for quotes, which will be attended to after Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2591.

433,30/09/2026,MATANOS AND KINYANIM (GIFTS),"We have seen that doing business (buying and selling goods) is forbidden on Shabbos (based on the concern that one will come to write). Gifts Chazal included non-business transactions in this prohibition, 2594 such as giving gifts. 2595 The prohibition applies to both the giver and the receiver. How- ever, if the gift is for a mitzvah or for Shabbos, it may be given. 2596 It follows that one may give edible food as a gift on Shabbos. Furthermore, if it gives a person genuine joy to give another person a gift, he is permitted to do so. 2597 • On Sukkos (that is not Shabbos), one may give his lulav to another person as a gift in order for him to fulfill the mitzvah. 2598 (On the first day of Sukkos, the lulav must belong to the one shaking it, so the giver can stipulate, “It is a gift to you on condition that you return it after you fulfill the mitzvah. If you do not return it, it is not a gift [and you will not have fulfilled the mitzvah].”) • One may give a birthday gift to a friend if it gives him joy to do so. • Although there is a debate regarding what kinds of gifts are forbidden, 2599 one should avoid giving a present to a bar-mitzvah boy on Shabbos. If one did so, the bar-mitzvah boy should preferably only accept ownership of it after Shabbos. • One may give wine or cake to his hosts on Shabbos, because food may be given as a gift on Shabbos. There are several ways around this prohibition. The easiest is to give the gift before Shabbos begins. If that is not possible, one can appoint another person as an agent to accept the gift on behalf of the recipient before Shabbos. In that way, the recipient becomes the owner of the gift before Shabbos begins. 2600 If one did not do so, the recipient should only assume ownership of the gift after Shabbos, even though it was received on Shabbos. • If Chaim wishes to give a gift to Yosef, it is best to give it to him before Shabbos. If he cannot do so, he can appoint Aharon as Yosef’s agent before Shabbos. He hands the gift to Aharon, who raises it, saying, “I hereby accept this gift on Yosef’s behalf.” Aharon can then hand it back to Chaim for safekeeping. Because Yosef is already the owner of the gift, it may be handed to him on Shabbos. However, if Chaim did not transfer ownership to Yosef before Shabbos, although he can hand the gift to Yosef on Shabbos, Yosef should only assume ownership of it after Shabbos has ended. As mentioned previously, if the gift is muktzeh , it is anyway forbidden to handle. A Vessel That Requires Immersion Giving something to a non-Jew is included in the prohibition. However, as we have said, it is permitted for a genuine Shabbos need. For example, if one did not tovel (immerse in a mikvah) a vessel that requires immersion before Shab- bos, he may give that vessel to a non-Jew as a gift, and immediately borrow it back from him (as only the vessels of a Jew require immersion). In this way, the vessel may be used on Shabbos. However, this is only permitted if one genuinely requires that vessel for Shabbos use. 2601 After Shabbos, when the Jew re-acquires the vessel from the non-Jew, it should be toveled without a brachah , as it has now transferred into his ownership. 2602",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2594.

434,01/10/2026,MATANOS AND KINYANIM:  OTHER ACQUISITIONS,"We have seen that giving and receiving gifts on Shabbos are included in the prohibition of doing business on Shabbos, and are prohibited unless it is for a mitzvah or Shabbos need, the gift is food, or if the giver gets genuine joy to give it. As mentioned, where there is a buyer and a seller, acquisitions are generally forbidden. 2603 We will now bring a few examples. Marriage The Torah defines marriage as a man acquiring a woman. This form of acquisition is also forbidden on Shabbos. 2604 However, there are extenuating circumstance in which a Rav may permit it. 2605 Pidyon HaBen A firstborn baby boy who was born through a natural birth and whose par- ents are neither Kohanim nor Levi’im must be redeemed from a Kohen for five silver coins (or the monetary equivalent) on the thirty-first day of his life. This is known as pidyon haben , and is considered an acquisition by the parents. There- fore, if the thirty-first day falls out on Shabbos, the pidyon haben is postponed until Sunday. 2606 Taking Ownership We have seen that one may not benefit from a melachah that was done for a Jew on Shabbos. Similarly, one may not take ownership of any item that arrives through a melachah on Shabbos. 2607 • If one ordered a package and stipulated that it be delivered on Shabbos, he may not benefit from it until the amount of time that it would have taken for the package to arrive after Shabbos has passed. Moreover, one may not acquire ownership of it on Shabbos. Instead, he can instruct the courier to put it down, and only pick it up in order to take ownership of it after Shabbos has ended (see Day___). Ownerless Objects One may acquire a hefker (ownerless) object on Shabbos, provided that it is not muktzeh . 2608 • One may pick up and acquire a book from a box that has been left out for the trash. • One may not acquire an old computer that has been left out for the trash. However, one can move it with a shinui (abnormally) to a safe place. If it is a valuable piece of equipment from a company that went out of business, one may ask a non-Jew to safeguard it until after Shabbos, but he should not explicitly ask the non-Jew to carry it home for him if doing so involves a prohibition. 2609",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2603.

435,02/10/2026,SHTAREI HEDYOTOS  (WEEKDAY READING),"Introduction Chazal prohibited many activities on Shabbos, as they were concerned that they would lead to melachos . One of these activities is reading money- or busi- ness-related documents, and even personal letters. Some say that the reason for the prohibition is because this type of reading constitutes pursuing weekday interests, 2610 while others say____ that it was prohibited out of a concern that it would lead to mochek (erasing). 2612 Chazal saw fit to extend the prohibition beyond documents that relate to business. They also prohibited reading from a guest list (out of a concern that one would find a discrepancy and correct it). 2613 Similarly, reading captions un- derneath pictures is also prohibited. The documents falling under this prohibition may not even be read silent- ly. 2614 Whether one plans to buy an item or not is not relevant. • One may not read bills or accounts on Shabbos, even if they are in Hebrew. (Note that they are generally muktzeh .) • One may not read business publications, advertisements, catalogues, or flight schedules on Shabbos. 2615 • Although we have said that one may inconspicuously look at a shop window on the street, one may not check prices or details. Shul Advertisements One must be careful not to read the advertisements that often appear in shul publications and Jewish magazines. Unfortunately, many err in this regard, especially because the ad is often more striking than the content of the publica- tion! One may read the list of those who sponsored the publication (even if it includes business names). 2616 If the advertisement is for a mitzvah, such as an ad for lulavim and esrogim, there is reason to be lenient, especially if no price is advertised. 2617 Similarly, one may read documents that are necessary for his health. 2618 Similarly, one may read a list of names indicating who has and has not re- ceived an aliyah , as well as a list of yahrtzeits , so that the aliyos can be fairly allocated. 2619 The same applies to a list of sick people. 2620 Letters In general, one may not read mail on Shabbos, as it falls under this Rabbinic prohibition. However, one may read mail for the first time if there is a possibility that it contains essential information about a mitzvah or one’s health. However, one may not read the words out aloud. 2621 Moreover, this only applies if the delivery of the mail did not directly involve a melachah . One may not read letters that are of a business nature even for the first time, and even silently. Furthermore, if one is concerned about losing them, they are muktzeh and may not be handled. 2622 Even in cases where it is permitted to read a letter, one is not allowed to tear open an envelope and certainly, one may not open it where it is attached with glue, even if he avoids the writing. But one may hint to a non-Jew to open it for him if he is permitted to read what is inside. 2623",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2610. Rosh ,  Shabbos  23:1.

436,03/10/2026,"SHTAREI HEDYOTOS: ENJOYMENT,  HEALTH, AND EDUCATION","We have seen that reading money- or business-related documents is prohib- ited. We also saw that the prohibition extends to reading a guest list or captions under pictures. We also discussed that one may read lists that are required for a mitzvah or that are necessary for one’s health. 2624 Newspapers It is praiseworthy not to read newspapers on Shabbos. 2625 Moreover, it is forbidden to read information about economics and business in any publica- tion on Shabbos. 2626 One may certainly not read the dedicated business- and money-related articles, and any advertisements. 2627 Indeed, some Poskim rule that such a newspaper is muktzeh , even if it also contains Torah thoughts. 2628 Reading for Enjoyment Some people derive enjoyment from reading general professional publica- tions. Although some contend that this is justified under the mitzvah of oneg Shabbos (enjoying Shabbos), it is preferable to avoid doing so. Business publica- tions are always prohibited on Shabbos, even if they bring pleasure. 2629 However, one may read a manual for a children’s game, as it will give them oneg Shabbos , and we are more lenient with regard to children as it is more im- portant for them. 2630 Medical Information One may read notices about matters that concern his health. One may also read the nutritional information that is printed on the packages of food products, as well as health publications (without reading the advertisements). 2631 School Newsletters Educating one’s child is a mitzvah, and so, one may read a newsletter that is directly connected to his child’s education, such as progress made during the week and even future gatherings.

437,04/10/2026,SHTAREI HEDYOTOS:  SECULAR MATERIAL;  TESTS,"We are discussing the prohibition to read business- or work-related docu- ments on Shabbos. Secular Wisdom There is a dispute whether Chazal included books that deal with secular sciences and knowledge in this prohibition. The Mishnah Berurah rules that although one can be a lenient, a yirei Shamayim (God-fearing Jew) should avoid doing so, due to the many Poskim who rule that it is forbidden. 2632 • Although a doctor may read medical journals on Shabbos, a God-fearing doctor should avoid doing so if possible. (Obviously, material directly related to saving a life can and must be read when necessary.) Studying Studying for tests on Torah topics is permitted on Shabbos, as learning Torah is a mitzvah, regardless of the reason for doing so. (In any case, the test is only there to promote higher standards of learning.) However, studying for tests on secular topics involves a number of issues. First, it may be included in the prohibition of reading business- or work-related documents. 2633 Second, it may be considered preparing for after Shabbos. 2634 Third, one should view all weekday activities as finished and complete once Shabbos begins. 2635 Although none of these reasons is conclusive enough to forbid reading such material, it is definitely advisable not to do so. Either way, it is forbidden to verbally express that one is studying for a test that will take place after Shabbos. It is worth mentioning that Shabbos is the mekor habrachah — the source of all blessings and bounty for the week. Giving Shabbos honor is more likely to bring one success than his own efforts on Shabbos. • One may study for an upcoming Gemara test. However, a medical stu- dent should ideally not study for his university exams on Shabbos. Stories of Tanach or from the Medrash as well as tales of righteous people may be read, as they bring a person to grow in fear of Hashem. 2636 Although one may read fiction to children if they need it, it is advisable to use such opportunities to teach them Torah values using the Torah material mentioned above.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2632. Mishnah Berurah  307:65; see  Orchos Shabbos , vol. 2, p. 393, which mentions that the decree  was only on papers, not on books.

438,05/10/2026,SHTAREI HEDYOTOS:  JEWISH MAGAZINES;  SAD MATERIAL,"We have discussed three halachos regarding the prohibition to read on Shabbos: 1. Business-related documents are forbidden. 2. Material that is related to a mitzvah or to one’s health is permitted. 3. Science and other books of secular knowledge may be permitted, but one should ideally be stringent. Jewish Magazines and Newspapers On the one hand, reading Jewish magazines on Shabbos should certainly be forbidden, and according to some, they would even be muktzeh . The reason is because these generally contain articles on politics, economics, and business. They are loaded with advertisements (although some are related to mitzvos and good health). On the other hand, there are often stories of tzaddikim and Torah thoughts. The children’s section includes educational facts about the world, as well as tips on staying healthy and developing good character. Although there is no written ruling on this, it would seem that the custom is to be lenient, 2637 on condition that one avoids reading the business and political articles and any advertisements. One should try to use these magazines as a means to grow, and not simply to waste time. (See the footnote.) That said, Torah learning is the greatest occupation of all, and cannot be compared with modern and entertaining (albeit Torah-based) material. Bad News One should try to be happy on Shabbos. Therefore, reading and speaking about something that generates feelings of sadness is forbidden. 2638 However, if it is necessary for a mitzvah , it is permitted. • One should not speak about terrorist attacks, or about people who are sick (God forbid), as it will surely cause sadness. • One may read information pertaining to a funeral or a shivah, but only if he intends to attend.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2637. We mentioned previously that it is preferable to avoid reading professional material  (non-business), even though it is a mitzvah of  oneg Shabbos . That said, there still may be reason  to allow it if one does so purely out of enjoyment, and not out of a desire to know more (which  sharply differentiates from the original prohibition of business documents) (see  Orchos Shabbos   22, footnote 218). Furthermore, the Jewish world is constantly bombarded by secular media.  It could be argued that Jewish publications are a decent and worthy substitute for time that is  not spent learning Torah. Again, if one can learn Torah instead, that is better than anything else.

439,06/10/2026,HATALAS GORALOS (LOTTERIES),"Chazal prohibited drawing lots on Shabbos, on the basis that it is similar to making an acquisition (which, as we have seen, is prohibited lest one come to write). 2639 Equal Portions Drawing lots to determine allocation of prizes or portions is permitted when allocating equal but different portions within a family setting. In other words, it is permitted when the sole purpose of the drawing is to avoid jealousy or fighting. • In a family setting, one may draw lots for a box of chocolates in which the chocolates are of different types, but are all the same size. However, drawing lots to determine the allocation of prizes or portions that are not equal is prohibited. Furthermore, if the lots are not in a family setting, or the participants may resent the outcome of the lottery, one may not hand out the portions in this way. • If three brothers purchased a large roast together and each brother is hoping for the piece with the least amount of fat, they may not draw lots on Shabbos to decide how to divide the roast. For Mitzvos Drawing lots is forbidden even for the sake of a mitzvah. Furthermore, tick- ets may not be used. 2640 • One may perform a draw, without using tickets, to distribute prizes for children who davened or said Tehillim, or to allocate aliyos to the Torah.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2639.

440,07/10/2026,MEDIDAH (MEASURING),"Chazal enacted a prohibition against measuring things on Shabbos. 2641 There is some discussion regarding the reason for this prohibition. Some say that it constitutes uvdin d’chol (weekday activities), which does not fit with the stature of the holy Shabbos. 2642 Others say that it is to prevent acquisitions, and ultimately prevents one from transgressing kosev (writing). 2643 The prohibition applies even if one does not use a measuring instrument. Note that a measuring instrument is generally muktzeh , and may only be moved if one requires the space that it occupies or for a permissible use. • One may not measure the weight of a fruit in order to be paid back by someone who is borrowing it. • It is correct not to measure the size of a room using one’s feet unless one does so for the purpose of mitzvah. 2644 Leniencies There are several instances in which Chazal did not apply the prohibition. Obviously, if the instrument involved uses electricity, it is forbidden even in these cases. For No Purpose Measuring is only prohibited when one does so in order to achieve a specific size, weight, or volume. If one does so out of habit or for no use whatsoever, it is permitted. 2645 • One may use a one-minute sandglass as a toy, but he may not use it as a timer for a game. 2646 As mentioned, measuring instruments such as a sandglass are muktzeh , and may only be used as toys or for other non-measuring uses. Imprecise Measurements One may measure in an imprecise manner, or when one does not care if what he is measuring turns out significantly more or less. 2647 • One may scoop out candies from a container using a measuring cup, as he does not care if more or less is scooped out. Measuring Without an Action One may measure if it does not require any action. • One may use a watch or clock to time something, as it ticks regardless, and the main purpose of the clock is to tell the time, not to measure. 2648",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2641.

441,08/10/2026,"MEDIDAH, CONTINUED","We have seen that measuring a precise amount is forbidden, even if one does not use a measuring instrument. We also discussed the leniencies of measuring for no purpose, measuring in an imprecise fashion, and measuring without an action. We will now discuss a few more leniencies. Mitzvah Measurements One may measure in order to perform a mitzvah. 2649 (As mentioned, using an electric or battery-powered measuring instrument is always forbidden on Shabbos.) • One may measure a wine glass in order to determine if it is large enough to use for Kiddush. • One may measure portions of matzah and marror that are required to eat at the Seder. • One may check that a sukkah exceeds the minimum size. • If milk fell into a meat cholent, one may measure the likely amount of milk that fell in to determine if it is less than one-sixtieth of the meat content contained in the pot and the cholent. 2650 For an Ill Person One may measure the required amount of medicine or food for one who is ill, as keeping healthy is a mitzvah. 2651 • An ill person or pregnant woman who has been told to eat on Yom Kippur may measure out the amount of food that they were permitted to eat, if necessary. (In any such case, one must consult a Rav .) Similarly, one can measure an ill person’s temperature with a mercury ther- mometer. 2652 One may not use a thermometer that flashes the temperature, as it is considered a form of writing. 2653 One must also not use a digital thermometer, as aside from causing the number to flash on the screen, it is electric, which is prohibited. If it is necessary to do so and one of these is the only option, one should consult a Rav . Also, if there is the slightest question of danger to life, all Shabbos prohibi- tions must be waived without hesitation if necessary. For a Child As we have seen in the halachos of refuah , a child is Halachically considered ill. Therefore, one may measure (with something that does not involve electricity or writing) if it is necessary for the health of the child. However, it is preferable to estimate. 2654 • One may measure the proportions of formula and water to prepare for an infant. However, if the proportions do not need to be exact, it is preferable to estimate them. On Yom Tov One may cook on Yom Tov if it was not possible to do so beforehand, or if the food would get ruined somewhat by doing so. In such a case, one may mea- sure spices and ingredients for cooking in the same manner that he does during the week. However, one may only measure by volume (such as with a cup), not by weight (such as with a scale, even if it is manual). 2655",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2649.

442,09/10/2026,RECHITZAH  (BATHING AND SHOWERING),"Chazal prohibited bathing and showering with hot water on Shabbos, as it can lead to the Torah prohibition of maavir (lighting a fire). 2656 For the purposes of this prohibition, hot water is defined as anything as hot or hotter than what a normal person would bath in. 2657 We will discuss bathing in cold water in due course. Important Foreword to This Prohibition It should be noted that whenever we rule that bathing or showering is per- mitted, this is only the case where the other Halachic issues have been avoided. For instance, if turning on the hot water causes cold water to enter the electric boiler and get heated up, or causes the gas to ignite, doing so constitutes the Torah prohibitions of bishul (cooking) and maavir (lighting a fire), respectively. Similarly, using a cloth or towel when washing may lead to transgressions con- nected to the prohibition of sechitah (squeezing). Moreover, turning on elec- tricity is prohibited according to most Poskim under the Rabbinic prohibition of molid (creating), and according to some, it may even constitute the Torah prohibition of maavir (lighting a fire) or boneh (building). The halachos discussed are applicable only when the only issue is the Rab- binic decree of rechitzah (bathing). Hot Water There is a distinction between water that was heated with an action on Shabbos, and water that was heated before Shabbos, or water that was passively and permissibly heated on Shabbos (as we will discuss in Day___). If the water was actively warmed up on Shabbos, one may not wash any part of the body with it. 2658 However, if it was heated up from before Shabbos or passively heated up on Shabbos, although one may not wash most of the body (or more), even if he does so limb by limb, he may wash a minority of the body. 2659 • If one filled a basin with hot water before Shabbos, he may not wash most of the body with it. However, he may wash a minority of his body, such as the hands, feet, and face. • If a non-Jew filled up a hot bath on Shabbos (even for himself) and decided not to use it, a Jew may not use it to wash himself, as it was heated up on Shabbos.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2656.

443,10/10/2026,RECHITZAH: WATER THAT  WAS HEATED AUTOMATICALLY;   HOT-WATER FAUCETS,"We have seen that water that was actively heated up on Shabbos may not be used to wash any part of the body. However, if it was warmed up before Shabbos, one may use it to wash a minority of the body, limb by limb. We also cautioned that any permissible washing discussed may only be applied when the various other prohibitions have been avoided, including cooking cold water when it flows into hot water, electrical components of the water system, igniting the gas, and using wash- cloths or towels. Passive Heating on Shabbos As mentioned, one may not use any water that was actively heated up on Shabbos. However, some Poskim say that water that was passively heated up without any act may be used to wash a minority of one’s body, even if it was heated up on Shabbos. • If water in a solar-powered boiler was cold before Shabbos, and during Shabbos it automatically got boiled up in the boiler, one may use such water, but only for a minority of his body, since he did not actually do an act of heating it up, 2660 but only with the important condition below. • If one leaves cold water near a radiator before Shabbos, and it becomes hot on Shabbos, he may use it to wash a minority of his body. • Similarly, if one set a timer to cause the boiler to heat the water on Shabbos, he can only use it to wash a minority of his body, 2661 but only with the important condition below. Important condition: Hot-Water Faucets We mentioned that opening a hot-water faucet causes cold water to enter the boiler and get heated up, constituting the melachah of bishul (cooking). The only way to use a hot-water faucet is to ask a non-Jew to open it, and only if there is a real need (see Day___). 2662",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2660.

444,11/10/2026,RECHITZAH: CHILDREN;   EXTREME DISCOMFORT,"We have seen that water that was actively heated up on Shabbos may not be used to wash oneself. However, if it was warmed up before Shabbos or passively warmed up on Shabbos, one may use it to wash a minority of the body. We also cautioned that any permissible forms of washing discussed may only be applied once the various other issues have been dealt with, including cooking cold water flowing into hot water, electrical components of the water system, and using washcloths or towels. We also noted that opening a hot-water faucet always constitutes bishul on Shabbos, and may not be opened by a Jew. Children The prohibition against washing with hot water also applies to children. 2663 One may only wash a child with water that was heated up before Shabbos or passively heated up on Shabbos, and only a minority of his body. But as this is a Rabbinic prohibition, there is a leniency that may be applied to children and to one who is sick. If the child must be washed for health reasons, one is permitted to wash the whole child with water that was heated up before Shabbos or heated up passively on Shabbos. Furthermore, a baby who is bathed every day may also be fully bathed on Shabbos under the same conditions, if necessary. 2664 (Obviously, one may not transgress any of the Torah prohibitions that apply.) In addition, one may ask a non-Jew to do any necessary melachos for a small child or a sick person. • If one’s five-year-old child becomes dirty while playing in the garden, one may not wash his whole body in hot water that was actively heated up on Shabbos. However, if cleaning him with cold water will leave a rash, it is permitted. It cannot be repeated enough that one must avoid the various Torah transgressions that apply, such as boiling water or opening the hot-water faucet, squeezing a cloth or towel, or using an electric water system. One may ask a non-Jew to perform some of these acts if necessary. • One may wash an eight-day-old baby on Shabbos before his bris with hot water that was heated up before Shabbos or passively on Shabbos. However, one may not wash him with hot water after the bris. 2665 Extreme Discomfort According to some Poskim , one who is experiencing extreme discomfort may wash his whole body with hot water that was heated up before Shabbos or passively on Shabbos. 2666 This is only if the discomfort cannot be alleviated in some other way. Again, one may not transgress any melachos when doing so. A person who is extremely uncomfortable may ask a non-Jew to open the hot-water faucet, but not if he is merely uncomfortable. 2667 It is best to consult a Rav in such cases.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2663.

445,12/10/2026,RECHITZAH: COLD WATER;  MIKVAH,"We have been discussing the halachos of showering or bathing using hot water. 1. If the water was warmed up before Shabbos or heated up automati- cally on Shabbos, one can only wash the minority of his body. 2. If the water was warmed up through an act on Shabbos, one cannot use that water to wash himself at all. 3. One may wash the whole body using hot water that was heated up before Shabbos or passively on Shabbos for children and sick people who need to be washed for health reasons, babies who are washed every day, and people that are genuinely in great distress. 4. One must never open the hot-water faucet on Shabbos — only a non-Jew may do so. 5. In all cases, one may not desecrate Shabbos in other ways. Therefore, one may not turn on the boiler, squeeze the cloth or towel, etc. Even a non-Jew may not do these except for a child, baby, or sick person (but not for a person who is merely in distress). Cold Water According to the strict letter of the law, one may wash his entire body with cold water on Shabbos. However, the Poskim record the minhag (custom) not to wash one’s entire body, lest one do some other melachah in the process, such as squeezing hair or towels. 2668 Regardless, one may wash a minority of the body with cold water. It follows that one may not bathe in cold water on Shabbos. However, if one is truly very uncomfortable, he may take a cold shower. 2669 • One may dip his feet in a pool on Shabbos, provided that he does not wet grass, squeeze a towel, or transport water on himself outside of an eiruv . Swimming One may not swim on Shabbos. This is a separate decree from the one we have been discussing until now. Chazal were concerned that one would build a boat or weave a raft. 2670 Although this particular prohibition only applies to wide rivers and the ocean (but not to common swimming pools), 2671 the custom not to wash one’s body in cold water still applies everywhere else. The Mikvah Having discussed the prohibition to wash the body with hot water and the established custom not to bathe even with cold water, we will now discuss the permissibility of immersing oneself in the mikvah on Shabbos. It should be noted that the halachah may differ according to the custom of the place. Before we discuss the details, it is worth repeating that even in cases where it is permitted to dip in the mikvah, one must be certain not to squeeze any water out of hair or a towel, carry outside of an eiruv , or sprinkle water on any plants, or transgress any other Torah or Rabbinic prohibition. Women It is permitted for a woman whose mikvah night falls out on Friday night to immerse. Although it is better to only use mildly warm mikvah water (i.e., not as hot as a normal bath), 2672 the prevalent custom is to allow even hot water. 2673 The mikvah water is generally heated up before Shabbos and is set on a timer. However, if the mikvah night was supposed to be earlier and was postponed (which should be avoided in any case, except for a reason sanctioned by a Rav ), a Rav should be consulted. 2674 In all cases, one should not remain in the water for longer than is neces- sary. 2675 Preparations for the mikvah, including showering, combing hair, and cutting nails, should be performed before Shabbos. If this was not done or is not possible, a Rav should be consulted. Men There are two reasons why men would immerse in a mikvah. In the past, there was an enactment that a man who had become impure through a seminal emission must immerse in a mikvah before praying or learning Torah. The decree was annulled a few hundred years afterwards, but it is still considered exemplary to do so. A man who wishes to immerse in a mikvah for this reason may not do so in hot water. Rather, he may use mildly warm or cold water. 2676 (Obviously, one must be sure to avoid any other Shabbos prohibitions.) Some men are accustomed to immerse in a mikvah to elevate their level of sanctity, even if they are not in an impure state. The Mishnah Berurah rules that one should avoid doing so on Shabbos, even in a cold mikvah. 2677 It should be noted that there are many mitigating factors and different cus- toms in this regard, and one must follow his custom. This is why many Chassidim go to the mikvah on Shabbos, regardless. 2678",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2668. Shulchan Aruch ,  Orach Chaim  326:7;  Mishnah Berurah  326:21.

446,13/10/2026,RECHITZAH: BATHING OR SHOWERING  ON YOM TOV,"While we are on the topic of bathing and showering, let us discuss the dif- ferences regarding the application of these halachos on Yom Tov. Hot Water on Yom Tov The prohibition to wash the majority of one’s body, as discussed above, also applies on Yom Tov. 2679 This is true even if the water was heated up before Yom Tov. However, there are two mitigating factors that apply only on Yom Tov: Each Limb Separately If one only washes each limb separately instead of washing the entire body at once, it is permitted on the condition that the water was heated up before Yom Tov. This is true even if he ends up washing the entire body. 2680 Moreover, one may open and use the hot-water faucet on Yom Tov. However, one may not light a fire (such as in the case of a gas boiler) or turn on a boiler. A Minority of One’s Body One may even use water that was heated up on Yom Tov if he is only washing a minority of his body, such as his face, hands, and feet. 2681 Moreover, one may even add cold water to an urn (that is on) in order to wash his face, hands, and feet. As we have stated, one may open the hot-water faucet on Yom Tov, but he may not light a fire or turn on a boiler. • One may open the hot-water faucet in a shower on Yom Tov to wash off a few limbs. Children Like on Shabbos, a baby who is washed on a daily basis may also be washed with hot water on Yom Tov, even if the water was heated up on Yom Tov. How- ever, one may not heat up water exclusively for this purpose on Yom Tov. 2682 Cold Water The custom not to bathe in cold water on Shabbos also applies on Yom Tov. Therefore, one may not take a bath on Yom Tov, even if the water is cooler than his normal bath. That said, if one is truly very uncomfortable, he may take a warm shower (colder than what he is accustomed to). 2683 It is important to stress that all other prohibitions that pertain to washing, such as squeezing out water and using a system that runs on electricity, apply on Yom Tov, and one must be certain not to transgress any prohibitions.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2679.

Obviously, one must be cognizant of the other Shabbos prohibitions, such as cooking, cutting into small pieces, etc. • One may add previously squeezed lemon juice to warm water in a kli sheini in order to wipe his hands with it. 2689 Air Freshener There is no prohibition against making the air smell nice. Therefore, one may spray air freshener. For Other Reasons The prohibition applies even if one does an act that unintentionally imparts a smell for some other reason. However, if there is no other option, one may be lenient. 2690 • If one has no secure place to leave an esrog, he may leave it on a towel if he does not intend to impart the smell to it. • One may spray deodorant onto his body even if it will eventually im- part the smell to his clothing, because he does not intend to make the clothes smell better (and obviously, there is no option other than wear- ing clothes). 2691",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2684.

448,15/10/2026,SHEVITAT BEHEMTO  (RESTING ANIMALS) - THE PROHIBITION,"The Prohibition One may not do anything that causes any animal (even if it is not one’s own) to do any of the melachos on Shabbos. 2692 This is learned from a verse in the Torah, “And the seventh day shall be a Shabbos to Hashem your God; do not do any melachah , [not] you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant and your animal . . .” 2693 • One may not hit or otherwise cause an animal to carry an object in a public domain. • One may not hook an animal up to a plow, causing it to dig up the ground when it walks. It is worth mentioning that animals are muktzeh and may not be handled. The Positive Mitzvah In addition, there is also an obligation to ensure that one’s animals do not perform any melachos , even by themselves. This is based on the verse in the Torah, “[For] six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest, in order that your ox and donkey may rest . . .” 2694 Chazal understood that all animals are included in this commandment. 2695 • One may not leave a non-Jew in charge of his animals on Shabbos, lest the non-Jew cause them to work for him. 2696 Similarly, one may not lend or rent out his animals to a non-Jew over Shabbos. 2697 For the Sake of the Animal If the animal does the melachah for its own benefit, it is allowed. • One can leave his goat or cow in a place where it will undoubtedly eat grass, which constitutes the melachah of kotzer (harvesting). 2698",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2692.

449,16/10/2026,MECHAMER: RIDING AND  WALKING ANIMALS,"We mentioned that there is both a positive mitzvah to ensure that one’s animals do not do melachah on Shabbos, and also a prohibition to cause any animal to do a melachah . The prohibition of working animals and ensuring that they “rest” applies specifically to Torah melacho s. But if the act would be Rabbinically prohibited for the person himself, it is permitted to allow the animal to do so. Thus, to direct an animal in one’s own fenced-in courtyard (assuming he does not actually handle it, as it is muktzeh ) is permitted. 2699 Riding It is Rabbinically forbidden for a Jew to ride an animal on Shabbos, lest he detach a branch to hit it with so it will move faster. 2700 However, a non-Jew may ride a Jew’s animal as long as no Torah melachah will be transgressed. 2701 As far as the potential issue of hotzaah (carrying) (being that the animal will be car- rying the non-Jew in a public domain), since the rider could theoretically walk by himself, the animal is not considered to be doing the melachah of hotzaah . Animals’ Clothing Although one may not cause an animal to carry items from one Halachic zone to another, one may allow the animal to wear normal articles or clothing that a person himself could wear on Shabbos, such as clothing to keep it warm. But one may not place items that are an extra protection for it, such as items that identify it or protect it from being stolen. 2702 • One may not put a ribbon, muzzle, or bell on an animal and allow it to walk in a public domain, even if he attached them on before Shabbos. (A bell carries the additional issue of the Rabbinic prohibition to create sound. Moreover, outside of one’s property, it may look like one wishes to sell the animal. 2703 ) But one may place a body cover on the animal before Shabbos to protect it from the cold. Walking a Dog Walking a dog is permitted on Shabbos. However, in an area without an eiruv or in a public domain, one must ensure that the leash does not extend more than a tefach (3.15 inches/8 centimeters) outside of his hands. Furthermore, the leash must always be elevated higher than a tefach (3.15 inches/8 centimeters) above the ground. 2704 The leash must only be placed on the animal without moving it, since ani- mals are muktzeh . One must also not lean on the animal. Furthermore, he must be careful regarding making knots (the melachah of kosher ). It should be mentioned that in some areas, walking a dog on Shabbos may be considered a weekday activity.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2699. Shemiras Shabbos Kehilchasah  27:4.

450,17/10/2026,MISTAKES IN TEFFILOS,"On Shabbos, the Shemoneh Esrei ( Amidah ) has seven brachos , unlike the nineteen of the weekday one. If One Realized His Mistake After Completing Shemoneh Esrei If one mistakenly said the weekday Shemoneh Esrei , he must say the Shabbos one. However, if he mentioned “Shabbos” in the Shemoneh Esrei , he need not repeat it. 2705 If one mistakenly said the wrong Shemoneh Esrei at Mussaf , he must still say the Mussaf Shemoneh Esrei , unless he mentioned Shabbos Mussaf sacrifices. If One Realized His Mistake in the Middle of the Fourth Brachah If one inadvertently began the weekday Shemoneh Esrei during Maariv , Shacharis , or Minchah , he should complete the brachah that he is currently saying, and then continue from the fourth brachah of the correct Shemoneh Esrei ( Attah Kiddashta , Yismach Moshe , or Attah Echad , respectively). However, at Mussaf one must stop immediately, and continue with Tikanta Shabbos . 2706 If One Realized His Mistake at the Beginning of the Fourth Brachah If during Maariv , Shacharis , or Minchah , one forgot that it is Shabbos, and thus began the fourth brachah with “ Attah ,” and then realized that it is Shabbos before saying “ chonen l’adam daas ” as per the weekday davening, he must com- plete that brachah as he would in the weekday. He must then continue with the fourth brachah of the relevant Shabbos Shemoneh Esrei ( Attah Kiddashta , Yismach Moshe , or Attah Echad , respectively). If he knew that it was Shabbos, but he inadvertently started the fourth bra- chah with “ Attah ” due to rote, and then realized that he should be saying the Shemoneh Esrei for Shabbos, he can immediately start the relevant fourth brachah for the Shemoneh Esrei for Shabbos. 2707 This is true only if one realized his mistake after saying the word “ Attah ” in the fourth brachah . But if he said “ Attah chonen ,” he must complete that bra- chah as per the weekday, and then continue with the correct Shemoneh Esrei for Shabbos. 2708 If One Started the Wrong Shabbos Shemoneh Esrei If one started the wrong Shabbos Shemoneh Esrei , he can immediately skip to the correct one. For example, if in Maariv , one started the fourth brachah with the Shacharis one, Yismach Moshe , he should immediately start the correct brachah , Attah Kiddashta . As mentioned earlier, if he completed his Shemoneh Esrei and then realized his mistake, he need not repeat it since he mentioned Shabbos in it, unless it was for Mussaf , which requires mention of Shabbos sacrifices. 2709 If One Is Not Sure Which Shemoneh Esrei He Said If one is unsure whether he said the weekday or Shabbos Shemoneh Esrei , he must repeat it, since it is most likely that he said what he regularly says —the weekday one. 2710",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2705.

451,18/10/2026,MELECHES KATAN (THE HALACHOS OF  SHABBOS PERTAINING TO CHILDREN) - FOOD,"Food to a Child The verse states, “Do not eat these [prohibited insects] . . .” 2711 The word sochlum (eat them) can also be read taachilum (feed them). This is the source for the Torah prohibition to give prohibited food to a child. 2712 Although the verse is dealing with prohibited food, this halachah applies to all prohibitions, including those of Shabbos. 2713 • One may not tell a child to flip a light switch on Shabbos. Preventing a Child’s Melachah The verse states, “Do not do any melachah , [not] you and your son and your daughter . . .” 2714 The commentators learn from this that a parent must prevent his own child from doing melachah for the parent’s benefit. 2715 Moreover, if the child does a melachah for the parent, that act is considered a transgression for the parent if the parent could have stopped it. It follows that a parent may not even hint to a child to do a melachah . • One may not tell a child that the room is dark, hoping that the child will turn on the light. BENEFITIG FROM A CHILD'S MELACHAH In the same way that one may not benefit from the melachah performed by a non-Jew for a Jew’s benefit, one may not benefit from a child’s melachah that was done for an adult. Similarly, one must object when any child tries to do a melachah for one’s benefit, even if the child is not his own. However, if a child does a melachah for himself, not for the benefit of an adult, it is not considered a transgression by the parent.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2711. Vayikra  11:42.

452,19/10/2026,MELECHES KATAN: EDUCATING  ONE’S CHILDREN,"We have seen that a parent may not instruct his child to desecrate Shabbos. Moreover, a parent has an obligation to educate his child to do mitzvos. Chinuch A father is obligated to educate his children so that they will do the mitzvos once they reach adulthood. 2716 • Regarding prohibitions, a child must be educated from the age that he is capable of understanding that “no” means an act is forbidden. 2717 • Regarding positive mitzvos, such as lulav and esrog, a child must be ed- ucated from the point which he is able to perform the mitzvah correctly (both physically and mentally). Using Kiddush as another example, a child is obligated from the point where he understands the concept of the day of Shabbos. Children develop differently, and so, a wise parent must fulfill the above general guidelines within the context of the nature of the child and his relation- ship with him, in order to achieve the ultimate goal of ensuring that he grows up to be an observant Jew. Mothers and Outsiders There is a debate whether a mother is obligated to educate her children in mitzvos. That said, all agree that if she does, she has performed a great mitzvah. She is certainly obligated to educate her children in good character and fear of Hashem, as the verse states, “Do not forsake the Torah of your mother . . .” 2718 Preventing a Child from Transgressing Shabbos One is obligated to stop a child from doing a Torah prohibition even if he is not the child’s parent. A parent should even stop the child from doing a Rabbinic prohibition. 2719 However, if the child is not yet old enough to understand the transgression, one need not stop the child. • If a six-year-old is eating non-kosher food, one is obligated to stop him. However, although one is never allowed to feed the child such food, if the child is two, he need not stop him. (However, it should be noted that eating non-kosher food is detrimental to spiritual health, and the Poskim strongly emphasize that it is certainly praiseworthy to stop the child, regardless.) • If a six-year-old child wishes to turn a fan on on Shabbos, one may not allow him to do so. However, one need not stop an infant from doing so.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2716. Tosafos ,  Shabbos  121a;  Mishnah Berurah  343:6.

453,20/10/2026,MELECHES KATAN:  RABBINIC PROHIBITIONS,"We have discussed the basic rules regarding instructing a child to do a pro- hibition, benefiting from such an act, as well as educating him. We learned that there is no obligation to stop a child who has not yet reached the age of education from doing a prohibited act, as defined earlier. But once the child has reached the age of education, the parent and even others are obligated to stop him from transgressing a Torah prohibition. Regarding Rabbinic prohibitions, only the parent is obligated to stop it, and not others. Allowing Rabbinic Prohibitions for the Sake of the Child Some Poskim allow instructing a young child to do something that is Rabbin- ically prohibited in certain limited cases, where it will be for the child’s benefit. 2720 On the other hand, other Poskim are more stringent, and also require that the child under discussion not understand that he is doing something prohibited. 2721 It is thus advisable not to rely on this except in extenuating circumstances. • According to most Poskim , opening a refrigerator where the LED light was not removed constitutes a Rabbinic prohibition. One may generally not tell a child to open it. However, if he really needs something from the refrigerator, some Poskim allow an adult to tell the child to get food that the child wants. Once the refrigerator is open, he may take out whatever is necessary. Other Poskim require that the child not know that opening a refrigerator door causes a light to go on. Moreover, using electricity may constitute a Torah prohibition, so one should preferably be stringent. Note that one may not close such a refrigerator once it is open. He must prevent the door from closing by itself, such as by placing an obstacle between the door and the refrigerator. However, he need not stop a young child who wishes to close it. These halachos apply even if the child is old enough to understand that “no” means that an act is forbidden, until the child has reached the age of education.",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2720.

454,21/10/2026,MELECHES KATAN: TOYS INDEX,"As mentioned earlier, once a child has reached the age of education, one must prevent him from doing any prohibited act. The halachah regarding chil- dren who have not yet reached this age, as it applies to toys, is as follows. Torah Prohibitions If the toy carries a possible Torah prohibition (such as building, destroying, lighting a fire, or using electricity____ ), one may not hand the toy to the child. However, if the child is playing with it, one need not take it away from him, unless he has reached the age of education, as we have defined earlier. • One may not hand a toolbox to a child if he will build something that will last, which may constitute the melachah of boneh (building). How- ever, one need not prevent him from playing with it on his own unless he has reached the age of understanding. • One may not hand an electric keyboard to a child, as it uses electricity. However, one need not warn him not to play it unless he has reached the age of understanding. Rabbinic Prohibitions The same halachah applies to Rabbinic prohibitions, except that some Poskim allow one to hand it to the child if it is for the child’s benefit. • A doll that makes music carries the Rabbinic prohibition of making music (even if it is manual and does not use electricity). Similarly, a doll that flashes lights and has a battery inside is muktzeh (under the category of kli shemelachto l’issur ). One should not hand such a toy to a child. However, according to some Poskim , if the child is crying and really needs it, one may hand it to the child as long as there is no electric current or prohibition that will occur in doing so. 2723 • Making a tent using chairs and towels creates a temporary canopy, which is Rabbinically forbidden, and one should stop children who are old enough to understand Shabbos prohibitions from building it. (If it is already built, one should not dismantle it on Shabbos, as this would constitute a Rabbinic prohibition based on soser [dismantling]). • There is a debate whether using Lego to build functional items is for- bidden under boneh (building). The Poskim say that Lego should not be handed to children. However, one need not stop children from playing with Lego, as the prohibition itself is the subject of debate. 2724",27/07/2025 10:57,Rabbi Daniele Braude,"2722. Creating an electric circuit is forbidden according to all Poskim. Some rule that it constitutes a Torah prohibition, while most rule that it is Rabbinic.
