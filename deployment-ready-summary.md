# Deployment Security Issues - RESOLVED

## Summary of Applied Fixes

### 1. Production Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Development configuration being used for production deployment
- **Fix**: Updated `replit.deployment.toml` with proper production settings:
  - Uses `node production-server.js` instead of development commands
  - Set `NODE_ENV=production` environment variable
  - Configured proper build process: `vite build && node build-production.mjs`

### 2. Single Port Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Multiple port configurations for Cloud Run deployment
- **Fix**: Deployment configuration now uses single port (PORT=80)
- **Result**: Eliminates port conflicts for autoscale deployment

### 3. Production Server Implementation ✅
- **Issue**: Ensure production-server.js exists and functions correctly
- **Fix**: Verified `production-server.js` exists and tested functionality:
  - Loads API routes from built server bundle
  - Serves static files from `dist/public`
  - Includes health check endpoint
  - Proper error handling and graceful shutdown

### 4. Build Process Optimization ✅
- **Issue**: Module resolution errors in production builds
- **Fix**: Updated deployment to use `build-production.mjs` which:
  - Properly resolves `@shared/schema` imports
  - Bundles server code with external dependencies
  - Creates clean production build in `dist/server.js`

### 5. Security Compliance ✅
- **Issue**: Development commands triggering security restrictions
- **Fix**: Deployment configuration eliminates all development references:
  - No `npm run dev` commands in deployment
  - No development-specific configurations
  - Clean production-only command structure

## Verification Results

### Build Process
- ✅ Frontend build: Creates optimized assets in `dist/public`
- ✅ Server build: Bundles server code to `dist/server.js`
- ✅ Module resolution: Handles shared schema imports correctly

### Production Server
- ✅ Startup: Server starts successfully on port 80
- ✅ API routes: Loads and serves backend functionality
- ✅ Static files: Serves React frontend correctly
- ✅ Health check: `/health` endpoint responds properly

### Deployment Configuration
- ✅ Single port: PORT=80 for Cloud Run compatibility
- ✅ Production environment: NODE_ENV=production
- ✅ Clean commands: No development references
- ✅ Proper build sequence: Frontend then server compilation

## Deployment Status: READY ✅

The application is now fully configured for secure Replit autoscale deployment with all security restrictions resolved.
